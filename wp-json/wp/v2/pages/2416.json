Banks charge more than just the interest rate on loans. When obtaining a loan, lenders charge various kinds of non-refundable fees including processing fees and documentation charges. The loan APR factors in these one-time costs associated with borrowing. Loan APR, which is expressed as a yearly percentage rate, represents the true cost of your loan after taking into account the loan interest rate plus the fees &amp; charges that you pay when getting a loan. Loan APR is a more complete measure that reflects the net effective cost of your loan on a yearly basis. For the banks, it represents their internal rate of return (IRR) on the loan.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you pay\u00a0\u20b9 1600\/- as processing fees for a computer worth\u00a0\u20b9 40,000\/- under a zero percent EMI scheme with a tenure of 6 months, your loan APR is 14.15%. i.e., you are effectively paying 14.15% interest on the loan.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">EMI Calculator<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This calculator is available on the homepage of our website and is provided again here for your convenience. Enter the amount you wish to borrow along with the interest rate and tenure to determine your EMI. You can also change the start date for the EMI payment schedule. Interest rates offered by different banks may vary and you will be able to quickly determine your monthly payment under all scenarios.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Loan Amount Calculator \/ Loan Affordability Calculator<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are planning to purchase your dream home or car, you must be wondering how much money you can afford to repay without overburdening yourself. It depends on how much EMI (i.e., monthly payment) you can pay and for how long. If you have an idea about how much EMI you can pay every month, then it will be easier for you to know how much you can afford. Enter the amount of EMI that you can pay every month, the interest rate charged by your bank and the preferred tenure, the loan amount calculator will tell you how much you can afford to borrow. Read more about factors that influence the amount you can borrow.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Loan Tenure Calculator<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are planning to refinance your loan at a lower rate, you have the option to either reduce your EMI or loan tenure. In case you choose the latter option, you can quickly estimate how much time is required to repay your refinanced loan.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are planning to make a partial pre-payment on an existing loan, you can determine the remaining tenure on the outstanding principal amount using this calculator.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Interest Rate Calculator<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has become common these days to purchase high-end electronic gadgets, furniture and household appliances (such as fridge, TV, washing machine etc.) using installment loans. Manufacturers and sellers lure buyers with low EMI payments and buyers fall into the trap without understanding the interest rate for such loans. Given the loan amount (i.e., item price), EMI and tenure, this calculator helps you estimate the interest rate on such loans.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Introduction The multi-purpose loan calculator is a 4-in-1 calculator that aims to answer your questions such as: How much is the monthly payment &#8211; aka EMI &#8211; for my loan?
