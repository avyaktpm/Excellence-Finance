In such cases, you will either be asked to pay pre-EMI OR given an option to choose between pre-EMI and full EMI payments.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is Pre-EMI?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As you are probably aware, Equated Monthly Instalment (EMI) consists of Principal and Interest components. Pre-EMI is just the interest portion on the disbursed loan amount that you pay until the full disbursal is done. i.e., your home loan behaves like an interest-only loan on the disbursed amount until the completion of construction. Your EMI payments start after the pre-EMI phase. Until then, your money does not reduce even a paisa of the outstanding loan amount.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lets consider an example where you are borrowing \u20b9 40 lakhs @ 10.5% interest rate with a tenure of 20 years for an under-construction property. Lets say, the bank disburses the loan amount in 4 stages.<\/p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"73\" \/>\n<col width=\"221\" \/>\n<col width=\"166\" \/>\n<col width=\"188\" \/><\/colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #eeeeee;\">\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Month<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Stage<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Amount Disbursed<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Pre-EMI<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">01-Jan<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">On agreement<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 10 lakhs (20%)<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 8,750<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">01-Jul<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">On completion of foundation and ground floor<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 10 lakhs (20%)<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 17,500<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">01-Oct<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">On completion of first and second floor<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 10 lakhs (20%)<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 26,250<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">31-Dec<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">On completion of third floor and possession<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 10 lakhs (20%)<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\u20b9 39,935 (EMI)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As illustrated above, you would pay (8750 x 6) + (17500 x 3) + (26250 x 3) = \u20b9 2,36,250 as pre-EMI (interest) towards the disbursed loan amount. Your EMI of \u20b9 39,935 for the remaining 20 years starts from 01-Feb (i.e., a month after final disbursal).<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Pre-EMI vs Full EMI<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some banks allow you to pay full EMI even when the disbursal is being done in stages. If you choose &#8216;EMI under construction&#8217; option,\u00a0 you will start paying EMI from the beginning of construction, but your interest amount will be calculated based on the amount disbursed to the builder and the rest of the amount will be counted towards principal. i.e., EMI remains the same but the principal portion of the EMI would be higher and loan gets repaid quickly.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are given a choice between paying pre-EMI vs full EMI during the construction phase, which one should you choose? There are many arguments <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rediff.com\/getahead\/2006\/jul\/03loan.htm\">for<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/capitalmind.in\/2011\/05\/pay-pre-emi-or-full-emi-the-facts-revealed\/\">against<\/a> choosing between pre-EMI and full EMI. Paying full EMI, instead of pre-EMI, makes financial sense in all cases except the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">You are a financial expert who is capable of earning good returns consistently by investing the small principal portion elsewhere. Remember that you pay less Principal and more Interest during the initial loan tenure.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">You are an investor looking to sell the property as soon as the construction is complete.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">You are strapped for cash at the moment and expect a salary raise before you get possession of the house.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">You are renting while waiting for property possession and cannot afford to pay both rent and full EMI at the same time.<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">You love giving (more) money to the lender for longer duration &#8211; the construction period (typically 1-3 years) plus loan tenure (typically 10-20 years).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">On the other hand, paying full EMI ensures that at the time of possession, you experience the satisfaction of having paid off a portion of the outstanding loan amount along with the joy of owning a home.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What if the Builder agrees to pay the pre-EMI?<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2612\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2612\" style=\"width: 242px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2612 \" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/pre-emi-offer-672x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Special Offer\" width=\"242\" height=\"368\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/pre-emi-offer-672x1024.jpg 672w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/pre-emi-offer.jpg 722w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 242px) 100vw, 242px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2612\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Read the fine print on &#8220;special&#8221; offers<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Lenders and builders offer myriad schemes for under-construction projects that are hard to understand for buyers. Note that builders (and lenders) keep coming up with innovative schemes to attract buyers. One such scheme is the 80\/20 scheme.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>80\/20 (or 90\/10 or 75\/25) scheme<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This notorious scheme involves buyer making a 10 &#8211; 25% down payment towards the home and the rest is disbursed by the banks \/ HFCs. RBI took a serious note of Advance Disbursal Facility (ADF) by banks, wherein the developer gets an upfront disbursal of the entire loan amount without any linkage to the construction stages. In most cases, the builder would offer to pay the pre-EMI on behalf of the buyer for a fixed period. <a title=\"Banks must link disbursal of housing loans to construction stages: RBI\" href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/banks-must-link-disbursal-of-housing-loans-to-construction-stages-rbi\">RBI advised banks against such borrower un-friendly schemes<\/a> because a) \u00a0it would mean developers getting access to funds at cheaper interest rates and b) buyer would be left to fend for himself if the builder delays (or stops) either the pre-EMI payments or the project itself.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Do not agree to advance disbursal even if this is the only exciting project in town and the builder happens to be your very own Mama or Chacha.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Caution: More than half the projects are delayed<\/strong><\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anytime a builder talks about always delivering on time, show him this metric related to <a title=\"We will deliver on time since there's a penalty clause\" href=\"http:\/\/articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/2013-10-07\/news\/42794754_1_real-estate-prices-own-house-dream-house\" target=\"_blank\">on-time completion of housing projects<\/a> in various Indian cities.
