However, there can always be an element of subjectivity. For better clarity, you must contact your nearest SBI branch.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>For Studies abroad<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Job oriented professional\/ technical Graduation Degree courses\/ Post Graduation Degree and Diploma courses like MCA, MBA, MS, etc offered by reputed universities<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Courses conducted by CIMA (Chartered Institute of Management Accountants) &#8211; London, CPA (Certified Public Accountant) in USA etc<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Are the Expenses Covered under the Student Loan Scheme?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am copying these details from SBI website.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fees payable to college\/school\/hostel<\/li>\n<li>Examination\/Library\/Laboratory fees<\/li>\n<li>Purchase of Books\/Equipment\/Instruments\/Uniforms, Purchase of computers &#8211; essential for completion of the course (maximum 20% of the total tuition fees payable for completion of the course)<\/li>\n<li>Caution Deposit\/Building Fund\/Refundable Deposit (maximum 10% of tuition fees for the entire course)<\/li>\n<li>Travel Expenses\/Passage money for studies abroad<\/li>\n<li>Cost of a two-wheeler up to Rs 50,000<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any other expenses required to complete the course like study tours, project work etc<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Do I Need to Furnish Any Security?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depends on the loan amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For loans up to Rs 7.5 lacs, there is no need to provide collateral or third-party guarantee. Only your parent\/guardian needs to sign up as co-borrower.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For loan above Rs 7.5 lacs, you need to provide tangible security. This is, of course, in addition to parent\/guardian signing up as co-borrower.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are married, your spouse or parent(s)-in-law can sign up as co-borrower.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Much Loan Can I Get?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These parts are never very clear to me.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to cap on the maximum loan amount, there is provision on margin too.\u00a0<\/span>Margin is the portion of education cost that you need to fund from own pocket.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For cost of education up to Rs 4 lacs: No margin is required<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For cost of education above Rs 4 lacs: 5% for courses in India, 15% for courses abroad<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>In How Many Years, Do I Need to Repay the Loan?<\/h2>\n<p>Repayment starts one year after completion of the course.\u00a0You have an option to repay the loan in up to 15 years. Typically, the loan duration is 7-8 years.\u00a0Longer duration means lower EMI<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Do note tax benefit is available for only 8 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you avail a second loan later for another course, you have to repay the combined loan amount in 15 years after the completion of the second course.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tax Benefits on Repayment of Education Loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get tax benefit for payment of interest of an education under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act. Entire interest paid is tax deductible. There is no cap.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are a few conditions that need to be met before you take such tax benefits.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All such aspects have been discussed in detail in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/tax-benefits-on-education-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Moratorium during the Study Period<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is one aspect that makes an education loan product very different from a regular loan product. It is moratorium on loan repayment during the study period.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And it is needed too. How will a student repay the loan?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, the loan repayment begins one year after the completion of the course.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest during the study period (and the subsequent 1 year) gets accrued and is added to the loan amount. When you are ready to repay the loan, your EMI is calculated on the sum of principal and accrued interest.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, there is no compulsion to avail the moratorium period. You can choose to pay the interest amount during the study period too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em>Point to Note: <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avail tax benefit for interest payment only for 8 financial years (including the financial year in which you start repaying the loan). So, if you plan to pay the interest during the study period, keep this aspect in mind. <\/span>Personally, I believe tax consideration will only skew your decision-making. Start repaying the loan as early as possible.<\/em><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Documents Required for Availing the Loan?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admission letter<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statement of cost of study<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KYC documents of the student and parent\/guardian<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank account statements, IT returns, statement of asset and liabilities for parent\/guardian\/co-borrower<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to the bank for the exhaustive list of documents.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Interest Rates for SBI Student Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rates keep changing.
