The obvious reason is uncertainty about borrower income. However, there are many retirees who get regular pension. There is no income uncertainty about their income. Is there a home loan product targeted at such investors?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, LIC Housing Finance has Griha Varishtha Home Loan scheme meant for pensioners. Let us find out more about the scheme.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>LIC Housing Griha Varishtha Loan: Eligibility<\/h2>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-roman;\">\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>Retired pensioners<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from PSU insurers, PSUs, nationalized banks, and Central and State Government employees. Maximum age for such applicants at the time of taking loan: 65 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>current employees<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of PSU Insurers, PSUs, nationalized banks, Central &amp; State Government employees are eligible.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For both (i) and (ii), you are eligible <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>only if you are drawing pension (or eligible for pension) under defined <\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>benefit<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong> pension scheme (DBPS)<\/strong><\/span>, where the pension is pre-specified. You are NOT eligible if you receive pension (or will receive) under a defined <\/span>contribution<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> pension scheme such as NPS.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum age for taking this loan has not been specified.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spouse must be the joint applicant irrespective of the ownership of the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a reason why LIC Housing Finance is insisting on defined benefit pension scheme (DBPS). By the way, DBPS is the old pension scheme where the Government or your employer takes up the responsibility of providing you pension after retirement. With DBPS, there is certainty of income and the lenders can assess your application accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With defined contribution schemes such as NPS, there is no such guarantee. Firstly, NPS is market linked. Thus, the pension that you ultimately draw will be linked to the performance of the underlying investments. You can also choose how much you withdraw lump sum and how much to use for annuity purchase. Annuity rate can vary. Secondly, even if you have bought an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/when-purchase-annuity-plan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">annuity plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (that guarantees you income for life), you can still exit annuity plans after paying a penalty. Once you exit from the annuity plan, there is no cashflow from the plan. The lender wouldn\u2019t want to take such risk and thus insists on defined benefit pension scheme only.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>LIC Housing Finance Griha Varishtha Home Loan: Quantum of Loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no mention of the maximum loan amount on the website, you can expect calculation of loan eligibility to be no different than for other home loan products. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">The loan eligibility will be linked to your monthly pension, prevailing interest rate and the loan tenure.<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The children can be co-applicant in the loan and their income can be considered for higher loan eligibility and loan tenure.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>LIC Housing Finance Griha Varishtha Home Loan: Tenure<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>Maximum tenure for this loan shall be 30 years or until the borrower reaches the age of 80<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>, whichever is earlier.<\/strong><\/span> If you have a younger co-applicant (son\/daughter\/spouse) and the income of the younger applicant is considered for loan eligibility, then the criterion of 80 years of age shall apply to the younger applicant (and not you). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that if the income of the younger applicant is not considered, then the criterion of 80 years shall apply to you only.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Three Variants<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan is available under 3 variants, applicable to different scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>1) Six EMI Waiver Offer<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>Available only for purchase of ready-to-move-in flat or house<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, where Occupancy certificate (OC) has been obtained.

(there is lack of clarity about this)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EMI waiver is implemented through reduction in outstanding loan amount.\u00a0 Thus, you still must pay EMIs. On the dates of waiver, the outstanding principal amount goes down by the amount equivalent to 2 EMIs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must look at such contingent offers with a pinch of salt. No largesse from the lender. To avail this offer, you must not prepay any portion of the loan or delay any EMI payments. Exactly what the lender wants. I ha<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ve discussed the pros and cons of such an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/lic-housing-finance-pay-when-you-stay-6-emi-waiver-home-loan-schemes\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMI waiver offer from LIC Housing Finance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. While the timing of EMI waiver is different in the above post, it works in the same manner.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>2) Pay When You Stay Offer<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>Available only for under-construction properties. <\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not allowed for repair\/renovation or takeover of existing loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum loan of 20 lacs. Maximum loan of 2 crores. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you buy an under-construction property, you must pay both rent and EMI until you get the possession. And this can be burden on cashflows. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To provide, you can manage with paying just the pre-EMI (only interest) and not full EMI (principal + interest) until the construction of the house is complete. There is an additional limitation. The pre-EMI period cannot exceed 4 years or 20% of the sanctioned loan tenure, whichever is lower.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the house is delivered or the pre-EMI period expires, the loan must be repaid in the remaining loan tenure.
