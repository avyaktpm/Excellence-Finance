Along with ever increasing fuel prices and high inflation (especially food inflation), this would aggravate the financial burden of the common man. Weakening Indian Rupee could also mean further increase in fuel prices. It will test the ability of the borrower to meet his monthly financial commitments including loan EMIs. Borrowers with floating rate loans will feel the pinch of higher EMI payments in the short term. Slowing economy may impact job market and reduce growth prospects.<\/p>\n<p>On the positive side, deposit rates are likely to increase. If you have some savings, then higher yield should excite you. Its also a good time to look for bargains in the stock market. If you are sitting on a pile of cash, it may be a good time to buy a home as prices come down. Also, the general consensus is that the interest rates are peaking and would stabilize or decline soon. If this indeed turns out to be a short term measure to contain inflation, then the common man should emerge stronger for the experience.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised its repo rate &#8211; rate\u00a0at which it lends to banks &#8211; and reverse repo rate &#8211;\u00a0the rate it pays to banks for deposits &#8211; by a quarter of a percentage point to 8.25% and 7.25% respectively.
