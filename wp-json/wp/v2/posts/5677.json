The developers are sharing offers on their real estate projects too. Now, these offers can take any form.

The builder wouldn\u2019t say we were selling this property for Rs 1 crore until yesterday and today we are selling this for Rs 80 lacs. The builders may have<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/do-not-wait-endlessly-for-the-property-prices-to-come-down\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">their reasons<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for this. At least they wouldn\u2019t shout about this).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay some money now and the remaining later (say 20% now and remaining after 2 years or when the construction is complete).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gift vouchers (Exercise discretion. Gift vouchers can be of any type and can be quite useless).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will pay the interest on your behalf for some time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We will cover the stamp duty or you don\u2019t have to pay maintenance cost for a few years.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While any offer is good since it reduces the effective cost of ownership, you cannot take these offers at face value and need to look deeper. Following are the aspects you must keep these things in mind while evaluating such offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Don\u2019t Soften up on the Price<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negotiations work on reciprocity. If you are overwhelmed by the offer, you may not drive the bargain hard. Hence, your focus may shift from negotiating the price to getting the most out of the offer. You may end up overpaying for the property.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Understand the Ramifications<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5686\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/tata-realty-festival-offer.jpg\" alt=\"tata realty festival offer\" width=\"480\" height=\"195\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/tata-realty-festival-offer.jpg 480w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/tata-realty-festival-offer-300x122.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" \/>Tata Housing has an offer where they will cover the interest cost in excess of 3.99% p.a. for one year for select project. After 1 year, the borrower must bear the entire interest burden. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could be the issues here? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, Tata Housing may have tied up with a lender (bank, HFC or NBFC) for this offer. You must take loan from that very lender. For the first year, you pay 3.99% p.a. However, from the second year, the regular interest rate will apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, under this arrangement, let\u2019s say you have to take a Rs 50 lac loan for 20 years from Lender A. The loan interest rate is 7.5% p.a. but you pay only 3.99% p.a. for the first year.<\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 99.3336%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: center; width: 4.82042%; vertical-align: top;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Month<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;

By the way, this discount is not bad per se.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, to the more important point. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">What if given your credit profile, you could have borrowed from another lender at 7% p.a. <\/span><\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">The loan EMI would have been only Rs 38,765.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"> A savings of Rs 3.63 lacs over the loan term.<\/span> Even if we deduct the discount of 1.73 lacs (that is available with only 7.5% loan), you would have still saved 1.9 lacs over the loan tenure. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, the interest is not the only cost you bear. You may have to shell out more<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/home-loan-3-99-p\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in terms of processing fees and other ancillary charges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Avoid Offers Where You Must Spend More Money<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, this is just an opinion. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I suspect this if the developer is offering gift vouchers. For instance, the developer offers a gift voucher of 50% if you purchase an expensive item or experience. You must still spend the remaining 50% from your pocket. It could be an item\/experience you don\u2019t really want or need. These gift vouchers may have an expiry period.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And some of these vouchers can be quite useless. For instance, if someone offers a XYZ spa 75% discount voucher of Rs 1 lac to be used over the next 1 year, it is useless for me. But that\u2019s me. You may see merit in such vouchers. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, don\u2019t take these gift vouchers at face value. <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">Sit with a microscope and evaluate the utility of these gift vouchers for your lifestyle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The developers can be very generous with the gift vouchers because they know many of these vouchers may expire unused. Moreover, these vouchers (like the spa voucher I mentioned above) may not cost the developer anything. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we discussed any offer is good. However, some offers are better than the others. In absence of upfront discounts from the developers, prefer offers where the cost benefit is more objective and realizable and comes sooner.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The festival season is here.
