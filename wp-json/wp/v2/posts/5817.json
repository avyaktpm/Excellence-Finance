Here are the key highlights.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tax Slabs Remain Unchanged<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No changes have been made to the <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/budget-2020-highlights\/\">existing income tax slabs<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Interest on EPF Becomes Taxable<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you contribute more than Rs 2.5 lacs to your EPF account every year, the interest earned on the excess portion (over Rs 2.5 lacs) will be taxable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say you contribute Rs 4 lacs to your EPF account in the FY2022. Interest earned on the first 2.5 lacs will be exempt from tax. Interest earned over the excess contribution (Rs 1.5 lacs) will be taxed at your slab rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A couple of conditions apply<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\">This applies only to the contributions after April 1, 2021. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the contributions made until March 31, 2021, the interest earned on your contribution to EPF remains tax-exempt.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">This applies only to your contribution to EPF account<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Rules pertaining to employer contribution to your EPF account have not been changed.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, with EPF contribution, nothing is ever final. It is possible that the Government will take it back and make concessions. However, the Government has played this smartly. Not many will be affected because of this change. For you to be adversely affected right away, your monthly EPF contribution should not exceed about\u00a0 Rs 21,000 per month. For you to make that contribution, your basic salary should be over Rs 1.75 lacs per month. Clearly, not many will be affected immediately.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">However, this will clearly make VPF (Voluntary Provident Fund) less appealing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the proposed change is in addition to changes announced in the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/budget-2020-highlights\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Union Budget 2020<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 Last year, the employer contribution (cumulative) to NPS, EPF and superannuation funds in excess of Rs 7.5 lacs in a financial year was made taxable. Not just that, even the returns from that excess employer contribution were made taxable. The changes announced in Union Budget 2020 applied only to <\/span>employer contribution to your EPF, NPS and superannuation accounts.<\/p>\n<h2>ULIP Taxation Brought on Par with Equity Mutual Funds<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/budget-2018-highlights\/\">Budget 2018<\/a> made long term capital gains (LTCG) on sale of equity mutual funds taxable at 10%. The only relief was that Rs 1 lac of such LTCG was kept exempt from tax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, maturity proceeds from ULIP (Unit Linked Insurance Plans) were still exempt from tax. ULIPs can also invest in stocks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you invested in equity mutual funds, you had to pay tax on capital gains. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While ULIPs had their own share of drawbacks, they scored one over equity mutual funds because of the tax-free nature of maturity proceeds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The Budget 2021 intends to remove this undue tax advantage given to ULIPs. <span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\">If you pay more than Rs 2.5 lacs in annual premium (cumulative) for one or more ULIPs purchased on or after February 1, 2021, then the maturity proceeds will not be exempt from tax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>A few conditions apply:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing changes for ULIPs purchased before February 1, 2021. The proposed changes shall be applicable for policies purchased on February 1, 2021.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your cumulative annual premium for ULIPs purchased on or after Feb 1, 2021 does not exceed Rs 2.5 lacs, nothing changes for you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aforesaid proposal applies not just to maturity proceeds. It applies to partial withdrawals and surrender proceeds too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The gains from such ULIP funds will be as treated capital gains and taxed accordingly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>What Is Not yet Clear?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ULIPs have both equity and debt funds.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a ULIP is not exempt from tax, then sale of <\/span>ULIP equity fund<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may result in short term capital gain (taxed at 15%) or long term capital gain (taxed at 10%). Tax relief for LTCG upto 1 lacs on sale of equity shall apply to ULIP equity funds too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a ULIP is not exempt from tax, then sale of <\/span>ULIP debt funds may result in short term capital gain (taxed at slab rate) or long term capital gain (20% after indexation).<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that even switches between various schemes of a ULIP will result in tax liability. <\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Will need clarity on the above 3 aspects.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that, the amount received on the death of the insured person (death benefit), continues to remain exempt, irrespective of the amount of ULIP premium paid.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Tax Benefit under Section 80EEA Extended<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This section was introduced in last year\u2019s budget. Under Section 80EEA, you could avail tax benefit of Rs 1.5 lacs for interest payment on a home loan provided:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The home loan is sanctioned between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2021. <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>The end date has now been extended to March 31, 2022.<\/b><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The stamp duty value of the house must not exceed Rs 45 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must not own any house on the date of sanction of housing loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note this benefit under Section 80EEA is over and above the benefit of upto Rs 2 lacs for home loan interest payment under Section 24.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Additional Proposals<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rs 35,000 crores allotted for Covid vaccination.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Senior citizens above the age of 75 do not need to file income tax returns if their only source of income is pension and interest income.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customs duty on gold and silver revised downwards from 12.5% to 10%.
