However, this benefit comes with a caveat. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s first look at the old and the new slabs. The old slabs are also linked to the age of the taxpayer.

A lot will depend on what tax benefits you are currently taking. However, I do not agree with one of the assertions made by the Finance Minister. The FM thought that this will make tax-filing simpler and most taxpayers won\u2019t need the assistance of tax professionals. I don\u2019t agree. There is one more element of decision making now. Whether you should stay in the current tax regime or pay taxes under the new regime. Tax professionals (Chartered Accountants) should be super-happy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, I hope the level of mis-selling will go down. Many poor financial products are peddled to investors under the garb of tax-saving. And many investors fall for such products for precisely the same reason. Now that they have this option of new tax slabs, they may feel fine saying &#8216;No&#8217; to such products.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Dividend Now Taxable in the Hands of the Investor<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Till now, dividends given by the companies or the mutual funds were EITHER not taxable upto Rs 10 lakhs in the hands of the investor OR taxed at 10% beyond Rs 10 lakhs. However, the companies or the mutual fund houses deducted DDT (in the form of dividend distribution tax) before paying the dividend to the investors. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effective tax hit was ~20.6% for the dividend distributed by the companies while it was ~11.5% and ~28% in case of equity and debt mutual funds respectively. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, DDT has been done away with. The dividend shall now be taxable in the hands of the investor at their marginal tax rates. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, this benefits those in the lower tax brackets. Those in the 30% tax bracket won\u2019t like this decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Extension on Home Loan Tax Benefit under Section 80EEA<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Union Budget 2019 (July 2019), the Government had introduced Section 80EEA to provide additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lacs for interest paid on housing loans. This was over and above the relief on interest of Rs 2 lacs under Section 24 of the Income Tax Act. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The relief under Section 80EEA was subject to the following conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The home loan is sanctioned between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must not own any residential house on the date of sanction of loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Stamp Duty Value of the house does not exceed Rs 45 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember the tax benefit would continue to be available in the following years as long as the above 3 conditions are met. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the budget (2020), the relief has been extended by 1 year to the <strong>home loans sanctioned between April 1, 2019 and <\/strong><\/span><strong>March 31, 2021.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Remember, you will be able to take the tax benefit if you stick with the old tax slabs. If you opt for the new tax slab, you won\u2019t be able to avail this tax benefit.<\/p>\n<h2>#4 Tax-Free Employer Contribution to EPF, NPS or Superannuation Fund Now Capped<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employer contribution to NPS, provident fund or superannuation fund in excess of Rs 7.5 lacs per annum will now be taxable. Earlier, there was no cap on this tax exemption. Many high salaried taxpayers who were utilizing this route to save taxes won\u2019t like this.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Other Important Announcements<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LIC will go for an IPO. So, if you are not content with holding LIC policies, you will soon be able to hold its stock too. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deposit insurance has been increased from Rs 1 lac to Rs 5 lacs. Your savings deposits and deposits will now be insured up to Rs 5 lacs.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Source\/Additional Links<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiabudget.gov.in\/doc\/memo.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget Memorandum<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiabudget.gov.in\/doc\/Finance_Bill.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finance Bill, 2020<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.indiabudget.gov.in\/doc\/Budget_Speech.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Budget Speech<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, presented the Union Budget 2020 in the parliament yesterday.
