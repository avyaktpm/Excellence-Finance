In this post, let\u2019s look at loans against securities in detail and assess whether you must consider such loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Are Loans Against Securities?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name suggests, you can borrow against your financial investments such as shares, mutual funds, debentures, insurance policies, small savings schemes etc.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both banks and NBFCs offer Loan against Securities facility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Much Loan Can I Get?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Different banks and NBFCs will have their internal policies.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, loan amount will be lower for equity shares or equity MF units as compared to debt investments.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reason is that the value of equity investments can decline sharply. Banks or NBFCs provide a lower loan-to-value (LTV) for equity investments to guard their interest against such sharp declines. Banks need a greater cushion with equity investments.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you may get only a loan of Rs 5 lacs against equity shares\/MF units of Rs 10 lacs while you may get a loan of Rs 8 lacs against debt security of Rs 10 lacs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and SBI cap the maximum loan amount at Rs 20 lacs.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Not All Securities Are Created Equal<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks won\u2019t treat all securities alike. When it comes to giving loans, Rs 1 lac worth of a penny stock is not the same as Rs 1 lac worth of a Nifty stock.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank even differentiates between private sector and public sector banks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find the list of eligible securities for HDFC Bank<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/htdocs\/brochure\/loan\/loan_against_securities.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and the loan available against them. ICICI Bank too has a list of<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icicibank.com\/Personal-Banking\/loans\/loan-against-securities\/approved-scrips.page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">approved scrips<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> against which it provides loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is the Eligibility?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It appears the loans are available to customers with satisfactory past relationship.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is what I found on SBI website.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This facility is available to our existing individual customers enjoying a past satisfactory relationship with SBI and maintaining their DEMAT Account with <\/span><b>SBI Cap Sec<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is offered as an Overdraft or Demand Loan. Loan can only be availed in single name. NRIs are currently not eligible for this loan.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though ICICI Bank and HDFC Bank websites don\u2019t mention anything, it is quite possible that existing customers may have a better chance of getting a loan against securities. Unlike SBI, these banks didn\u2019t limit their depository participant (DP) to a group entity.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Is the Loan Offered? What Is the Tenor of the Loan?<\/h3>\n<p><b>Such loan can be offered as a demand loan or as an overdraft facility. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank and ICICI Bank offer only overdraft facility. On the other hand, State Bank of India offers both demand loan and overdraft facility.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tenor of the demand loan will be decided upfront while overdraft facility will be available for one year and subject to renewal every year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of overdraft facility, you only have to pay interest only on the utilised amount. However, in case of overdraft facility, the bank may limit your drawing power based on prevailing price of security.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is the Rate of Interest on Such Loans?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the loan is secured, you can expect the interest rate to be lower than personal loans.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rate<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for <a href=\"http:\/\/www.icicibank.com\/Personal-Banking\/loans\/loan-against-securities\/service-charges.page?#toptitle\">ICICI Bank<\/a>\u00a0provided loan against securities, in Q1FY2017, has ranged between 9.2% to 12.25% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For HDFC Bank, rates were higher for loans against equity investments. For Q1 FY 2017, average lending rate for loan against equity was 10.95% while 10.57% against debt investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Are There Any Restrictions on End Use?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan amount cannot be used for speculation or capital market activities. As I understand, subscription to rights issue is an exception.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What If the Price of the Securities Goes Down?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though financial institutions keep good margin of security, it is quite possible the market price of shares\/MF units decline sharply. In such cases, banks may ask you to furnish additional security or prepay the loan (at least of portion of the loan).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t do either, banks can liquidate your security and recover loan amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of overdraft facility, the bank may reduce the drawing power. This will automatically limit your ability to withdraw. In case you have already withdrawn more than the reduced Drawing power, you may have to repay excess amount instantly or pay penal interest.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan agreements have such covenants built in.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What If the Price of the Security Goes Up?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nothing will happen in case of a demand loan. I doubt bank will offer you additional loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, in case of overdraft, the bank may consider increasing your drawing power.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is Single Scrip Lending?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under single scrip lending, you can avail loan by pledging shares of one company. As expected, banks will permit single scrip lending for only high quality and liquid scrips. The bank wouldn\u2019t take this risk with lesser companies. This is quite justified too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With other scrips, the banks may demand shares from other companies too. For instance, HDFC Bank requires minimum two scrips (shares of two companies). Additionally, the single scrip shall not exceed 65% of the drawing power (overdraft facility).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What About Dividends and Bonuses on Such Pledged Shares?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any dividend or bonus will accrue to you (and not to the lender). You have merely pledged your shares. That does not mean you have forgone your right to receive dividends and bonus shares.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, bonus shares will automatically be pledged.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Points to Note<b> \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will get loan against only select securities. The list will be available on bank website. Hence, forget about taking loan against penny stocks you own.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank may offer different margin against different kind of securities. For instance, you may get up to 50% against Reliance shares and only 25% against a midcap company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have demat account with the same bank (DP), you may be able to apply for the loan online too. However, you still have to go through formal documentation. You can check the<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/htdocs\/common\/onlineservices\/LAS-Demo\/index.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">demo<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from HDFC Bank.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>How Is Security Created?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to pledge your securities to the bank\/NBFC.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the documentation process, you will have to fill up a pledge request form and submit it to the depository (NSDL or CDSL).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of mutual funds, you will have to send a letter to the AMC (mutual fund house) or RTA (CAMS\/Karvy) requesting them to mark lien in favour of the lender.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should You Opt for Such Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I don\u2019t think so. You may be much better off selling off those securities rather than taking loan against them. Interest rate for the loan is likely to be higher than the returns on debt mutual funds.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There might be a scenario where your investment is illiquid for some time, say in closed ended funds, Fixed Maturity plans (FMPs) or equity linked savings schemes (ELSS). In such a case, your hand might be forced.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a few cases, it is quite possible that your shares have gone down in value (loss aversion) and you don\u2019t want to sell those shares at a loss. You might feel that the stock price will rebound any day. Hence, you may be inclined towards taking a loan against the shares rather than sell those shares.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t fool yourself. Stock price will not revive just because you want to. Even if you hold shares of the best company in this world, you don\u2019t know when the price will reverse for good. That is the nature of equity markets. Sell those shares. When you have the money, buy those again. Keep things simple. Its q<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">uite possible that the price will run up from you sale price. Well, it is also possible that the price goes down from your sale price.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to exercise discretion. Don\u2019t be too optimistic about your stock pickings. Be rational.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Links<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/loans-against-assets\/loan-against-securities\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank: Loans against Securities<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/htdocs\/common\/onlineservices\/LAS-Demo\/index.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank: Demo of online application for loan against Shares<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/personal-banking\/loans-against-securities\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI: Loan against Securities<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.icicibank.com\/Personal-Banking\/loans\/loan-against-securities\/index.page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICICI Bank: Loan against Securities<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you are looking to raise short term funds quickly and have a sizeable investment portfolio, loan against securities is an option you can consider.
