This was before the RBI mandated all fresh floating rate loans to retail borrowers from October 1, 2019 to be linked to an external benchmark. SBI had used Repo rate linked lending rate (RLLR) as the benchmark. RLLR was set at Repo Rate + 2.25% p.a. This spread of 2.25% is completely internal to the State Bank of India. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In a sudden turn of events,<\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.financialexpress.com\/money\/alert-sbi-rllr-home-loan-scheme-stands-withdrawn\/1710828\/\"> <b>SBI withdrew RLLR linked home loan product<\/b><\/a><b>, barely 3 months after the product was introduced.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>What Could Be the Reasons for Withdrawing RLLR?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RLLR linked home loans had stringent<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/sbi-to-launch-repo-rate-linked-home-loan-product-in-july-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eligibility criteria<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 Among others, you must have a minimum annual income of Rs 6 lacs. SBI was offering both MCLR and RLLR linked loans since July. Further, the State Bank had discretion whether to allow existing borrowers on MCLR or base rate to shift to the RLLR linked loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11677&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI circular date September 4, 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> changed many equations.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, all the new floating rate loans (includes home loans) must be linked to an external benchmark. MCLR is clearly gone for the new loans. This option isn&#8217;t available for SBI from October 1st.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Secondly, the bank can use only one benchmark for a category of loans. It must be RLLR or some new freshly constructed benchmark for the home loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thirdly, as per the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11677&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI circular dated September 4, 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the existing borrowers whose loans are linked to MCLR or Base rate must be allowed to shift to the external benchmark for a reasonable fee.\u00a0 So, SBI can\u2019t stop existing borrowers from shifting to external benchmark. Not just that, if I understood it right, <\/span><b>the spread over the external benchmark rate (RLLR or any new one) to be used while shifting must be same as the new borrower with the same credit profile would get. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When MCLR was introduced, existing base rate borrowers could shift to MCLR but the spread over the MCLR was adjusted to keep the pre-shift or post-shift interest rate same (unless the borrower paid a fee). As I understand, the SBI won\u2019t be able to tinker around with the spread this time around. The bank can\u2019t charge a different spread (as compared to a new borrower with the same credit profile). Therefore, RLLR (or the new benchmark) must price in such possibilities too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, SBI could have foreseen margin pressure because the Reserve Bank changed Repo rates yet again in October monetary policy meet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps, SBI worked out that the RLLR or (Repo Rate +2.25% p.a.) was not enough. Hence, RLLR home loan product was withdrawn.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>And Hence Came EBR or the External Benchmark-Linked Rate<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI has now introduced a new benchmark called External Benchmark-Linked Rate or EBR. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like RLLR, EBR is also linked to RBI Repo rate. However, the benchmark spread has been increased from 2.25% to 2.65% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>EBR = RBI Repo rate + 2.65%.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RLLR was RBI Repo Rate + 2.25%<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI Repo rate (as on October 15, 2019) is 5.15%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, EBR comes out to 7.80% while RLLR stands at 7.40%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can check the latest home loan rate on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/interest-rates\/home-loans-interest-rates\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>As you can see, the best rate you can get (for home loan up to Rs 30 lacs) is EBR +15 bps. This translates to 7.95% p.a.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Before RLLR was withdrawn, the rate for the best borrower was RLLR + 40 bps. This comes to 7.80% p.a. Clearly, the customers have lost out a bit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, you can see the credit spread (not the benchmark spread) increases with the quantum of loan. Your nature of work (salaried or non-salaried), credit profile and the LTV ratio also affects the loan interest rate. Everything else being same, the Maxgain borrowers pay a higher rate of interest. There is a minor concession of 5 bps for the female borrowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should You Shift from MCLR to EBR?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the bank can\u2019t tinker much the spread at the time of shifting and the bank can\u2019t charge more than the \u201cReasonable administrative\/legal costs\u201d for such shifts, the decision is likely to be relatively simple. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You simply need to compare the final loan interest rate between MCLR and EBR. If you are getting a lower rate under EBR, shift to EBR or else maintain status quo. BTW, the bank may have a different interpretation for \u201cReasonable administrative\/legal costs\u201d. If the costs are not really reasonable, then you will have to do a deeper analysis. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In any case, EBR is likely to be more transparent. Moreover, the past experience suggests that the borrowers on the older benchmark don\u2019t really get a fair treatment.\u00a0 There are many accounts where Base rate or BPLR borrowers are paying far higher interest than if they had shifted to MCLR. Weigh in this aspect too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Happens to Existing RLLR Borrowers?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not sure if they can hold on to RLLR loans or they will have to compulsorily shift to the new External Benchmark-Linked rate (EBR). I think they can choose to stay back. They will of course have an option to shift to EBR (Externally Benchmark-Linked Rate). Between EBR and RLLR,\u00a0 RLLR is likely to be a cheaper choice too unless SBI tinkers with the credit spread for RLLR borrowers after a few years. When SBI does that, the borrowers can compare RLLR loan rate with EBR loan rate and decide.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>SBI had introduced home loans linked to RBI Repo rates as the benchmark in July 2019.
