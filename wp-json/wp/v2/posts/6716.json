Let\u2019s just focus on the net cash outgo.<\/p>\n<h2><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-5611\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/amazon-logo.jpg\" alt=\"amazon logo\" width=\"184\" height=\"96\" \/>Let\u2019s Consider an Example<\/h2>\n<p>I pick offers for a mobile phone on Amazon.<\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Product Name<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Minimum Purchase<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Max Discount CC\/CCEMI\/DCEMI<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Max Discount AmazonPay ICICI Credit Card<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OnePlus 10 Pro<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 60,299<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 6,000<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 2,985<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OnePlus 10R<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 35,099<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 1,000<\/td>\n<td>NA<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OnePlus Nord CE 2<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 21,599<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 1,500<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 420<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 17,999<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 2,000<\/td>\n<td>Rs. 1,100<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>You can see discount is more on the regular ICICI Bank credit and debit cards. But, in the Amazon Pay ICICI Credit card, you will also get 5% of the amount as cashback.<\/p>\n<h3>If You Were to Buy Lumpsum<\/h3>\n<p><b>On regular ICICI Bank Credit card<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Net cash outgo = 25,000 \u2013 1,500 (upfront discount) = <b>23,500<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>On Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit card<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Net cash outgo = 25000 \u2013 420 (upfront discount) \u2013 1,229 (5% cashback on 25,000-420) = <b>Rs 23, 351<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>5% cashback is available only for prime members. For non-prime members, cashback is only 3%.<\/p>\n<p>In this case, for a prime member, Amazon Pay ICICI Bank credit card is better for lump sum (despite a lower upfront discount).<\/p>\n<h3>If You Were to Buy on No-Cost EMI<\/h3>\n<p>As per T&amp;C of the deal, Amazon Pay ICICI bank credit card does not offer any upfront discount on EMI purchases. Remember you don\u2019t get any cashback on EMI purchases.<\/p>\n<p>On the regular card, you still get a discount of Rs 1,500.<\/p>\n<p>For both regular and co-branded cards, you will be charged a processing of Rs 199 plus GST = ~Rs 235.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Net cash outgo on regular ICICI Bank credit card<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>235 (Processing fee) + 6 X 3,917 (No-cost EMI for 6 months after discount of Rs 1,500) = <b>Rs 23,735<\/b><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><strong>Net cash outgo on Amazon Pay ICICI Bank Credit card<\/strong><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>235 (Processing fee) + 6 X 4167 (No-cost EMI for 6 months.

And use regular credit card for EMI purchases.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Now, you can have multiple permutations and combinations. In the above examples, I have just considered ICICI Bank cards. There may be offers on other cards too.<\/p>\n<p>There is no option that ends up winner in all scenarios. <b>By using these simple calculations, you can find out the best payment mode for your purchase.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>A Few Points to Note<\/h2>\n<p>Everything else being the same, <b>an 5% upfront discount is better than 5% cashback<\/b>. Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because a bird in hand is worth two in the bush. With upfront discount, you get the benefit upfront. No need to wait for the benefit. Cashbacks are contingent. Unless the cashback deal terms and conditions are very crisp, I wouldn\u2019t want to take the bet. <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/amazon-pay-icici-bank-credit-card-worth-it\/\">Amazon Pay ICICI Credit Card<\/a><\/strong> and <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/flipkart-axis-bank-credit-card-our-review\/\">Flipkart Axis Bank Credit card<\/a><\/strong> are examples where cashback structures are quite transparent. Not sure about other cards.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-banks-manage-to-provide-no-cost-emi-on-e-commerce-websites\/\"><b>No-cost EMI<\/b><\/a><b> may not always be better than interest-based EMIs.<\/b> If the no-cost EMI offer has a processing fee, it will increase the cost. Further, if taking the no-cost EMI means you lose out on upfront discount\/cashbacks, do a rethink. In fact, if you are losing out on upfront discount by opting for EMIs, consider buying by paying full (and get upfront discount) and asking the bank subsequently to convert your purchase amount into EMI.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While checking out from your favorite shopping app, you could get one of the following payment options on your credit\/debit card or Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL).
