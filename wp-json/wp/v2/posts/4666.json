However, that is not exactly the case. This benefit is applicable only for those whose income (after all the deductions) is up to Rs 5 lacs. If your income after deductions is in excess of Rs 5 lacs, there is no benefit for you. The Government has proposed to amend Section 87A where you will be provided relief.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Scenario 1<\/strong>\u00a0You have annual income of Rs 8 lacs. You invest Rs 1.5 lacs in PPF, 50,000 in NPS and pay Rs 1 lac on interest on home loan (Section 24).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your net taxable income= Rs 8 lacs \u2013 Rs 1.5 lacs \u2013 Rs 50,000 &#8211; Rs 1 lac = Rs 5 lacs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 5% tax slab, your tax liability before cess will be Rs 12,500. However, since you are eligible for rebate up to Rs 12,500, you won\u2019t have to pay any tax.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Scenario 2<\/strong>\u00a0If your income was Rs 20 lacs and the same level of investments, your net taxable income will be Rs 20 lacs \u2013 Rs 1.5 lacs \u2013 Rs 50,000 \u2013 Rs 1 lac = Rs 16.5 lacs. Since the income is greater than Rs 5 lacs, no relief under Section 87A shall be available.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Key Highlights from Interim Budget 2019<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Standard deduction increased from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This will lead to additional savings for salaried employees. Do note Standard deduction is applicable to only to salaried employees.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, to save capital gains tax on sale of houses under Section 54 of the Income Tax Act, the capital gains could be invested in just 1 new property. That has now changed. You can now purchase or construct up to 2 properties. There are a couple of conditions to be met. Firstly, the capital gain under question must not exceed Rs 2 crores. Secondly, you can avail this relief (purchase 2 properties instead of 1) only once in your lifetime.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>No TDS on interest income up to Rs 40,000 on deposits with bank or post offices.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Earlier, this limit was Rs 10,000. Please understand senior citizens already had their interest income up to Rs 50,000 exempt from income (TDS was also applicable for interest income on deposits in excess of Rs 50,000). This change provides relief to those under 60.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government contribution to NPS accounts of central Government employees increased from 10% of salary (Basic + DA) to 14% of salary. This had been notified earlier. Has been reiterated in the budget.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TDS on rent has been increased from Rs 1.8 lacs to Rs 2.4 lacs. Do note this rule is not applicable to individuals or HUFs. Therefore, our readers can safely ignore this.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>No tax on notional rent on second self-occupied house.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is a major relief for those who have a second house. Let\u2019s say you stay in Mumbai and have purchased a house there. You own a second house in your home town too, say Dehradun. You have not put the house in Dehradun on rent. Essentially, Dehradun property is your second self-occupied property. As per the tax laws, even though the house in Dehradun is not on rent, you will still have to add notional rent on the house in Dehradun and pay tax on it. In the Budget 2019, this notional rent concept for the second self-occupied property has been done away with.\u00a0<\/span>Now, this has interesting repercussion (not favourable) if you have purchased second house on loan. As per law,<a style=\"background-color: #ffffff;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/budget-2017-how-cap-of-rs-2-lacs-for-loss-under-income-from-house-property-affects-you\/\"> loss on income from house property (rental income \u2013 standard deduction \u2013 interest paid on loan) is capped at Rs 2 lacs<\/a>. Now that there is no notional income on the second house, the interest eligible for tax benefit under Section 24 will also go down.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sammaan Nidhi Scheme launched. Farmers with landholding up to 2 hectares will get Government support of Rs 6000 per annum (3 instalments of Rs 2,000 each). Expected to benefit 12 crore farmers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Pradhaan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandaan Yojana:<\/strong> For workers in the unorganized sector earning upto Rs 15,000 per month. Participants will get assured monthly pension of Rs 3,000 per month from the age of 60 till death. Your contribution will depend on age. Budget speech gives an example. A person aged 29 will have to invest Rs 100 per month. A person aged 18 will have to invest Rs 55 per month. The Government makes a matching contribution. Frankly, Atal Pension Yojana is a wild success. Personally, I do not see much need for this scheme.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This budget presented brings some major relief for the middle class tax payers.
