If you had a loan outstanding as on Feb 29, 2020, you would NOT have to pay interest on interest during the moratorium period of 6 months. Or in other words, you will not have to pay compound interest on loans, but only the simple interest.<\/p>\n<p>For the difference between compound interest and simple interest, refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-moratorium-impact-of-potential-interest-on-interest-waiver\/\">this post<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>Who Is Eligible for the Benefit under the Scheme?<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Following type of loans are eligible for the benefit:\n<ul>\n<li>MSME Loans<\/li>\n<li>Education Loans<\/li>\n<li>Housing Loans<\/li>\n<li>Consumer Durable loans<\/li>\n<li>Credit card dues<\/li>\n<li>Automobile loans<\/li>\n<li>Personal loans to professionals<\/li>\n<li>Consumption loans<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>As on Feb 29, 2020, you must not have sanctioned limits and outstanding amounts of more than Rs 2 crores. Note that the limits apply not to individual facilities but to aggregate of lending facilities across financial institutions) If your loan outstanding exceeds 2 crores, you won\u2019t get the relief.<\/li>\n<li>Your loan account must be standard as on February 29, 2020.<\/li>\n<li>You are eligible irrespective of whether you have fully availed (6 months) or partially availed (say 3 months) or not availed the moratorium.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Loans availed after Feb 29, 2020 are not eligible for relief.<\/p>\n<h2>How Much Relief Will I Get?<\/h2>\n<p>The Government has specified a simple method.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Consider Loan outstanding on Feb 29, 2020.<\/li>\n<li>Consider Loan Interest Rate (will vary for different types of loans)<\/li>\n<li>Calculate Compound interest for 6 months using such loan amount and interest.<\/li>\n<li>Calculate Simple interest for 6 months using such loan amount and interest.<\/li>\n<li>Relief = Compound Interest for 6 months \u2013 Simple interest for 6 months.<\/li>\n<li>This relief will be credited to your loan account by November 5, 2020.<\/li>\n<li>The Government will reimburse the banks for such relief provided to you.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>Points to Note<\/b><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You do not have to apply. The bank will auto-credit the relief in your account.<\/li>\n<li>Loan outstanding as on Feb 29, 2020 shall be considered for calculation.<\/li>\n<li>Subsequent payment\/prepayments\/withdrawals (after Feb 29, 2020) from the loan account will not affect the relief amount. This ensures that everybody, irrespective of whether they availed the moratorium or not, gets the similar benefit.<\/li>\n<li>While there is some confusion around this, as I understand, the interest rate as on February 29, 2020 shall be considered for calculation of the relief. Subsequent changes in interest rates\/penal interest for late payment shall not be considered for calculation of relief.<\/li>\n<li>For education loans, housing loans, Automobile loans, personal loans and consumption loans, the rate considered shall be as per the loan agreement.<\/li>\n<li>For consumer durable loans, if no interest is being charged on the loan (I am not sure what the Government is referring to. Even No-cost EMIs have interest rates), then lender\u2019s base rate\/MCLR shall be considered for such calculation)<\/li>\n<li>For Credit card dues, the interest rate to be used for calculation shall be the Weighted Average Lending Rates (WALR) charged by the credit card issuer for transactions financed on EMI basis from its consumers during the period from March 1, 2020 until August 31, 2020. Now, this interest rate can be much lower than the rate your bank charges on credit card overdues.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Will the Relief Be Meaningful?<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s look at a few examples.<\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 98.7954%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Loan Amount as on Feb 29, 2020<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">50,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">50,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">10,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">5,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">3,00,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Interest Rate as on Feb 29, 2020<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">8.0%<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">8.0%<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">10.0%<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">15.0%<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">36.0%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Outstanding Tenure as on Feb 29, 2020 (in months)<\/p>\n<p>(This does not affect relief amount)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">240<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">180<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">60<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">240<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">240<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Moratorium availed (in months)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">6<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">3<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">6<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 6<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">6<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Compound interest during the moratorium period<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">2,03,363<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">1,00,668<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">51,053<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">38,692<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">58,216<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Simple interest during the moratorium period<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\">2,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\">1,00,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\">50,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\">37,500<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\">54,000<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 46.6175%;\">Ex-gratia payment to be credited to Loan Account<\/p>\n<p>(this amount will be credited to investor loan account)<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 12.4231%;\"><b>3,363<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 11.3161%;\"><b>668<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.2091%;\"><b>1,053<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 8.61009%;\"><b>1,192<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right; vertical-align: top; width: 10.7011%;\"><b>4,216<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>As you can see, the relief amount is not significant, compared to the quantum of loan.
