Interest rates have moved down since and you can get a personal at a cheaper rate. Lower interest rate means lower EMI. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without any friction, you would move to the lower interest rate right away. i.e., take the new loan at a low rate and use the loan amount to close the high-cost old loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the banks wouldn\u2019t like this, at least the one that gave you the old loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Therefore, there are costs to discourage you from prepaying a loan. The regulations allow banks\/NBFCs to charge a prepayment penalty if you close a fixed rate loan. And personal loans are usually fixed interest rate loans. Depending on your loan terms, this prepayment cost can be up to 4% of the outstanding loan amount. And while the new bank is interested in getting business (you taking a loan from them), it is usually not satisfied with just the interest income. It needs some side income in the form of processing fees and other ancillary charges on a new loan.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>So, prepayment penalty on the old loan and processing fee of the new loan are costs that you must bear.<\/strong><\/span> And what do you get? Lower EMI. You save some amount every month. If the loan tenure is long enough, perhaps these monthly savings will be worth more than the cost incurred. Remember, the loan tenure is important. If the loan tenure is too short, you wouldn\u2019t likely be able to recover the cost.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, there are 4 variables here.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost of closure of existing loan (Prepayment or foreclosure charges)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upfront cost of taking a new loan (processing fee and other ancillary charges)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure (assume it is same for the new and the old loan)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Difference between the interest rates on the old and the new loan<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is fair to assume that the interest rate on the new loan must be significantly lower than the interest rate on the new loan, otherwise this entire exercise is meaningless.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Points to Note<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Switching costs will be upfront, while the savings due to lower interest rate will be spread over the loan tenure. <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>Thus, you must compare the upfront cost with the present value of discounted savings.<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, to keep things simple, we will not consider the time value of money.
