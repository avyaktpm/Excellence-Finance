The reason for non-repayment could be many, ranging from loss of job and improper financial planning to poor health, disability or even demise of the borrower.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In extreme cases, you could end up defaulting on your loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you miss an EMI or two, you would get a reminder or a notice from the lender. Your credit score may be affected but if your problem is limited to only a couple of EMI, there is as much as you will be affected. You can gradually repair your credit score through good credit behaviour over the next few years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if your cash crunch, for any reason, is not about to end soon and severely dents your ability to repay EMIs for a longer duration, you are looking at a much bigger problem. This will lead to a scenario where the bank will make aggressive attempts to recover money from you. This is unlikely to be a pleasant experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>What does a loan default entail? How will a loan default affect your as a borrower? What should you do if you are facing a loan default? As a defaulter, do you have any rights?<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let\u2019s try to answer such questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#1 Your Credit Score Will Take a Severe Hit<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, your credit profile will be severely damaged. You may find it difficult to take a loan or a credit card in the future.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel the credit score is important only if you want to apply for a new loan or a credit card, you are wrong.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit Score is assuming greater importance even beyond loans and credit cards. I had to submit my credit report to SEBI while submitting my application for Registered Investment Advisor. Don\u2019t be surprised if you are asked to provide your latest credit report along with your job application.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A poor credit score or report will go down as a negative and have an impact on your employment chances.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Be Prepared for Harassment from Recovery Agents<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_4276\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-4276\" style=\"width: 615px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-4276 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/merchant-of-venice.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"615\" height=\"480\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/merchant-of-venice.jpg 615w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/merchant-of-venice-300x234.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-4276\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Merchant of Venice &#8211; Shylock Demands His Pound of Flesh<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is more likely to happen in case of unsecured debt such as personal loans and credit cards. Since the bank does not have any security for these loans, it cannot auction anything to recover its dues.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lender may appoint a recovery agency to recover its dues from you.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though RBI has<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/rbi.org.in\/scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=4141&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">clear guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about the recovery agents engaged by banks, I am not sure if the guidelines are followed well in practice.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note even though unsecured loans are not backed by security, the loan is still given under an agreement. The lender can easily take you to court to recover its dues. However, since the judicial process is likely to be expensive and long drawn out, this is likely to be the last resort for them.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you had given a post-dated cheque for EMI payment, a cheque bounce also gives them an ability to file an FIR against you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Loan Guarantor Will Also Face Problems<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you sign up as a guarantor for a loan and the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender will also come after you.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A loan guarantor is not just a nominal figure. Banks don\u2019t ask for a guarantor for nothing. From the perspective of the bank, if the borrower does not pay, you have to pay. Liquidating assets (even if you have the asset as security) is a complex legal process and can be challenged by the owner on many grounds.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pressuring the guarantor to pay on the behalf of the borrower is a much quicker and simpler way.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, think twice before<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/signing-up-as-loan-guarantor-beware-of-risks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">signing up as a loan guarantor<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Lender Can Attach and Sell Your Assets in Case of Secured Loans<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is typically the last resort.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have defaulted on a secured loan such as a home loan or auto loan, the lender can repossess the asset and auction it to recover its dues. Any excess consideration received during the auction will be passed on to you.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand it is not so simple to auction the security. A due legal process has to be followed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Legal Heirs Won&#8217;t Be Spared Either<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the borrower passes away without repaying the debt, the lender can approach the legal heirs to repay the loan (in case there is no guarantor or the co-borrower). However, the liability of any legal heir can\u2019t be more than their share of inheritance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are Your Rights as a Loan Defaulter?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you have defaulted on your loan, you are not a criminal. By the way, even criminals have rights.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a borrower, even if you have defaulted, <\/span><b>the bank needs to give you ample notice before repossessing your property. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the loan account is classified as Non-performing asset (NPA), the lender needs to give you a 60-day notice to rectify the situation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fail to repay in those 60 days, the bank can sell asset (security) by giving you another 30-day notice mentioning details of sale\/auction. <\/span>Such details may include fair value of the asset\/property, reserve price, date and time of auction.\u00a0If you do not agree with the fair value of the property\/asset, you can contest it<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and find prospective buyers on your own (who may be willing to offer better price).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any balance proceeds from sale of assets (after squaring off the loan) will come to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Additionally, you deserve respect, even from the recovery agents.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> They can meet you only at the place of your choice. Of course, if you don\u2019t specify, they will try to contact you at your residence or place of work. They can contact you only between 7 am and 7 pm. However, I am not sure if these guidelines are not followed by recovery agents or enforced by banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Can You Do to Avoid Such a Scenario?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t wait for the default to happen before you act.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, the debt problems do not surface out of the blue. Frankly, you will be the first person to realize that you are facing debt issues. And this will happen much before you actually default. <\/span>Don\u2019t ignore the signs. Take pro-active action.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I have discussed many such steps in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-to-get-out-of-debt-trap\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand this is easier said than done. However, you must make an honest attempt to resolve the problem on your own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If nothing works, <b>you can approach the lender <\/b>and try to explain your case.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your problem is genuine, they can offer you some concession. The concession may be in the form of deferral of payments for a few months, extension of loan tenure (that reduces the EMI), reduction in interest rates or a one-time settlement.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand that these concessions may have side-effects. For instance, the bank may impose penal charges. CIBIL score will be affected in any case. However, don\u2019t expect the bank to go out of the way to make concessions for you. They will not write off the loan just because you seem like a nice guy. Moreover, this is only a temporary relief. Therefore, this approach is likely to work if your problem is temporary.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Source\/Credit<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/wealth\/borrow\/all-about-personal-loans\/articleshow\/56352098.cms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Economic Times: Five rights of loan defaulters<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.livemint.com\/Money\/9Dram94rdVwReoP2MN8bUM\/Keep-these-rules-in-mind-while-facing-a-loan-recovery-agent.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LiveMint: Keep these rules in mind while facing a recovery agent<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><em>Author&#8217;s\u00a0<\/em><em>Disclaimer \u2014\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not a legal expert and have limited understanding of enforceability of contracts and legal rights of the lenders and the borrowers.
