Your cash flows for the month are already stretched. You realize that you won\u2019t be able to make full payment towards your credit card dues. You are aware that the interest on credit card debt (or unpaid amount) is extremely high. You stumble upon an item <i>Minimum Amount Due<\/i> in your credit card statement? It is a small fraction of the total outstanding amount. You are wondering what Minimum Amount Due (MAD) means? Does it mean you will not be charged any interest if you pay the Minimum Amount Due? What if you do not even pay the Minimum Amount Due? Let\u2019s find out everything you need to know about Minimum Amount Due.<\/p>\n<h2>How Does Paying Minimum Amount Due Help?<\/h2>\n<p>Minimum Amount Due is the minimum amount that you need to pay to the bank\/credit card company by the due date <b>to keep your account regular and avoid payment of any late payment fees.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Payment of minimum amount due ensures that you get away with paying only the interest. There will be no late payment or other finance charges applicable. Additionally, if you keep the account regular by paying MAD by the due date, the bank will not report your account as irregular to the credit bureaus. If your credit card account is reported irregular, your credit history\/score will be adversely affected. This can be a problem if you are planning to take a loan in the near future.<\/p>\n<p><b>By paying the minimum amount due, you cannot avoid interest on the unpaid amount.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>How Is Minimum Amount Due Calculated?<\/h2>\n<p>Minimum Amount Due is typically 5% of the balance outstanding on the statement date. If you have opted for EMI balance transfer or purchase on EMI, that amount will also be added to your Minimum Amount Due. Any unpaid Minimum Amount from previous statement will be added to your current minimum amount due to arrive at total Minimum Amount due.<\/p>\n<p>For the rest of this post, let\u2019s assume the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Credit card is generated on 5th of every month<\/li>\n<li>The payment has to be made by 26th of every month<\/li>\n<li>Interest will charged at 3% per month<\/li>\n<li>Late payment fees of Rs 500<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Illustration<\/h2>\n<p>Let\u2019s try to understand the calculation with the help of an example.<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Date<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Transaction<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Amount<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Remark<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>June 15<\/td>\n<td>Purchase<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">10,000<\/td>\n<td>You get interest free period.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>July 5<\/td>\n<td>Statement<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">10,000<\/td>\n<td>Due date July 26.

So, you are not avoiding high interest cost by making the minimum payment.<\/p>\n<p>In August, since you didn\u2019t make the minimum payment, late payment fees was charged.<\/p>\n<h2>No Interest Free Credit Period If You Only Pay the Minimum Amount Due<\/h2>\n<p>If you are making regular and full payment to your credit card account, you can get interest free credit for up to 52 days. You will get up to 21 days to settle after your credit card statement date to clear the outstanding amount. \u00a0Interest free credit period\/grace period may vary across banks\/credit card companies.<\/p>\n<p>For your purchases made between August 6 and September 5, the payment due date will be September 26. So, for the purchase made on August 5, you will have to pay the dues on or before September 25, 2015. This gives you a maximum period of 52 days to settle the dues. Of course, if you make the purchase later, you will lesser number of days to settle the dues.<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Purchase Date<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>Interest free credit period on purchase<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>August 6, 2015<\/td>\n<td>52 days<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>August 30, 2015<\/td>\n<td>26 days<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><b>However, if you have not made the full payment and paid only Minimum Amount Due to keep your credit card account regular, you will not get any interest free credit period.<\/b> You will be charged interest from the date of purchase.

You will continue to be charged interest on this purchase till such time you settle the dues for this purchase.

You made this purchase on the first day of your credit statement cycle. You choose to minimum payment due every month. Additional, you do not make any additional purchases for any future months.

You should always strive to make credit card payments in full. Payment of Minimum Amount Due can be an option for short term cash flow crisis.

However, this can only be a short term arrangement.<\/p>\n<p>We have already seen how long it will take to settle the dues if you keep making the minimum payment.
