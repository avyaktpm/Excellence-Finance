The scheme was originally available for investment till May 2018.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a family was allowed to invest only Rs 7.5 lacs in the scheme.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the investment limit has been hiked to Rs 15 lacs per senior citizen (and not family).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Effectively, a senior citizen couple can now invest Rs 30 lacs in total (earlier they could invest only Rs 7.5 lacs).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Tax Benefit for Critical Illness under Section 80DDB Hiked to Rs 1 Lac<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, senior citizens can take tax benefit for medical expenses on critical illnesses to the extent of Rs 1 lac per annum.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, the limit was Rs 60,000 for senior citizens and Rs 80,000 for very senior citizens. Now, the limit for both is Rs 1 lac per financial year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the taxpayers below the age of 60, the limit has been left unchanged at Rs 40,000 per annum.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that you can take benefit only for such medical expenses which have not been reimbursed by your medical insurance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#6 Interest Income up to Rs 50,000 Exempt from Tax for Senior Citizens<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, for senior citizens, there shall be no TDS until your interest income exceeds Rs 50,000 in the financial year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is much needed relief for senior citizens. Many of them rely on such interest income. Not only does this put more money in their hands, but it also saves them hassles running around banks to submit Form 15H.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that this relief is available for deposits with banks, co-operative banks and post-offices. All kinds of deposits with these entities including savings accounts, fixed deposits, recurring deposits, Senior Citizen Savings scheme etc will come under the ambit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A new Section 80TTB will be added. For TDS relief, relevant changes will be made to Section 194A.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note this relief is only for Senior Citizens. For taxpayers less than the age of 60, there is limited relief of Rs 10,000 (only for savings account interest).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Those senior citizens who have availed tax benefit under Section 80TTB can\u2019t take relief under Section 80TTA. Makes sense too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#7 Long Term Capital Gains (LTCG) on Sale of Equity\/Equity Shares Are Now Taxable<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4188 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/LTCG.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"449\" height=\"358\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/LTCG.jpg 449w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/LTCG-300x239.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a big setback for many investors.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Till now, long term capital gains (holding period &gt; 1 year) on sale of listed shares and equity mutual fund units was exempt from tax.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not any more.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Finance Minister has proposed to tax such long term capital gains at 10% without the benefit of indexation.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, no such tax needs to be paid if such LTCG is less than Rs 1 lac for the financial year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, gains accrued till January 31, 2018 shall be grandfathered.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means, while calculating your tax liability, purchase price will be higher of (Your actual purchase price, Highest price on January 31, 2018). This is applicable for all share sales after April 1, 2018.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tax on Short term capital gains remains unchanged at 15%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#8 Dividend from Equity Mutual Funds Is Now Taxable<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, the dividend from equity mutual funds was exempt from tax.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, AMCs will deduct Dividend distribution tax (DDT or TDS) of 10% before making you the dividend payment. Effectively, the AMC pays the tax on your behalf but it comes form your money only.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Investing in dividend schemes of mutual funds, anyways, did not make much sense to me (barring a few exceptional cases). However, with Rs 1 lacs of tax shelter for growth schemes (as mentioned in the previous), growth option is much more advantageous.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To read about this topic in greater details, suggest you go through<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/taxes\/budget-2018-long-term-capital-gains-equity-equity-mutual-funds-introduced\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#9 Tax Relief for LTCG Now Restricted<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can save long term capital gains tax by investing in NHAI and REC bonds under Section 54EC.
