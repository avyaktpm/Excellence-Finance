This will give the entire framework much needed credibility. You can go through<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11137&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI master directions on Peer to Peer lending platforms<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> dated October 4, 2017 here.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the key points of RBI directions.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The P2P lending platform must register as a Non-Banking Financial Company.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>The aggregate exposure of a Lender to all the Borrowers across P2P platforms shall not exceed Rs 10 lacs at any point of time. <\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(No matter how attractive the rates are, you can\u2019t lend beyond a point).<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>The aggregate loans taken by a Borrower from all the Lenders across P2P platforms shall not exceed Rs 10 lacs at any point of time.<\/b> <i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(So, don\u2019t pin hopes on borrowing a very big amount from these platforms)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><i><\/i><b>The exposure of a single lender to a borrower across all the P2P platforms shall not exceed Rs 50,000. <\/b><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(Good, as a lender, this stops you from putting too much money with the same borrower).<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P2P platform must obtain a certificate from the borrower\/lender that the above limits are being adhered to.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>The maximum duration of the loan can be 36 months. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, a high rate of interest and the short loan duration is a problem for both the borrower and the lender.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>P2P platform cannot provide any kind of principal or returns <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">guarantee. That means risk of lending is exclusively yours (i.e., lender\u2019s).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><i><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P2P platforms are required to register with all the Credit Information Companies (CIC) such as CIBIL and furnish credit information to the CICs on a regular basis. (<\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a borrower, if you thought you could escape a hit to your credit score in case of a default, you are wrong.)<\/span><\/i><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, P2P cannot facilitate secured lending from its platform. You will get (or give) only unsecured loans.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A P2P platform cannot lend on its own.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest rates displayed on the website shall be in Annual Percentage Rate (APR) format.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>As a lender on the platform, you are entitled to details about the borrower including personal identity, required loan amount, interest rate sought and credit score (as determined by P2P lending platform).\u00a0As a borrower<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>, you will get details about lenders\u2019 proposed loan amount and interest rate offered. You are not entitled to personal identity and contact details of the lenders.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is the funds transfer mechanism as per the RBI circular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4150\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/funds-transfer-mechanism.png\" alt=\"P2P Funds Transfer Mechanism\" width=\"542\" height=\"589\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/funds-transfer-mechanism.png 542w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/funds-transfer-mechanism-276x300.png 276w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>If You Are a Borrower<\/h2>\n<p><b>Be prepared to pay a very high rate of interest.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When I checked some of these websites, I couldn\u2019t find interest rates below 20% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These websites claim to facilitate from 12% p.a. to 30% p.a. The interest rate will depend on your credit rating and your nature of employment. These P2P lending platforms may use internal rating methods too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note these platforms are marketplaces. You will probably quote the rate you are willing to borrow at. Lenders will decide if they want to lend at that rate given your credentials. If you don\u2019t find enough lenders, you may have to increase your borrowing rate.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Clearly, if you can can get a cheaper personal loan from Banks\/NBFCs, there is no reason why you should opt for loans through such platforms.<\/strong>\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, interest is not the only cost. <\/span>P2P platform will have its cost too.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> I checked the fees &amp; charges\u00a0by\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.faircent.com\/interest-rates-and-fees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Faircent<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.i2ifunding.com\/how-p2p-lending-works\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">i2iLending<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><b>P2P platforms are charging up to 3-8% of the loan amount as the processing fee. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The processing fee depends on the creditworthiness of the borrowers.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is huge by any standards. As I see, these costs could also be higher due to lower loan amount and other operational expenses.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may also be asked to pay for <\/span>loan insurance<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that is likely to add up to the cost.\u00a0<\/span><b>An upfront processing fee and the insurance cover cost will shoot up your actual borrowing cost much higher.<\/b>\u00a0You need to see if you can repay the loan.<\/p>\n<p>If you manage to borrow and repay the loan, it helps improve your credit score. An improved credit score could help you get a loan from traditional lending institutions (banks and NBFCs) at a later date. However, if improving your credit score is your only goal, you are better off getting and repaying a secured loan (<a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-bank-fixed-deposit-fd\/\">Loan against FD<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-lic-policies\/\">Loan against LIC Policy<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/gold-loan-unlocking-cash-for-emergency-needs\/\">Gold Loan<\/a> etc.).<\/p>\n<h2>If You Are a Lender<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a lender and you can see the exorbitant overall cost for the borrower, it is not always something to be happy about. Don\u2019t forget you are lending to a person who is already financially stressed. And when you lend, you want to get your money back.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">P2P lending platforms will rate borrowers based on their proprietary (internal) rating methods. This information may be useful to you before you decide to lend to specific borrower. Clearly, higher the credit rating of the borrower, lower the interest rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>If you are planning to lend money through Peer-to-Peer lending platform, here are a few things you must keep in mind.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The money relationship is between you and the borrower. The P2P platform has limited role to play in terms of documentation and exchange of funds.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a default, it is between you and the borrower. P2P platform may help in following up but it can\u2019t reimburse your loss or share legal costs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If someone is willing to borrow money at 20% p.a., you must understand he\/she must have exhausted all the cheaper options to borrow and must be desperate to borrow.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>In my opinion, the odds are stacked against you to begin with.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, at the same time, you get the reward in terms of high interest rate. You need to see if the reward is worth the risk.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to take the risk, it may be prudent to divide your lending between different types of borrowers (borrowers with different credit ratings). That way, you will be able to diversify some of the borrower risk.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don&#8217;t simply pick borrowers that are willing to borrow at the highest rates. Understand the risk of non-payment involved will be the highest for such borrowers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest income from such lending provides a monthly cash flow, but will be taxable.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Although you may think of this as another option for investing your surplus money, liquidity is a big issue here. Once you lend your money, it could be gone for up to 3 years. You cannot &#8220;cash out&#8221; in case of emergencies. The lender has very little recourse if suddenly there&#8217;s high default rate due to economic turmoil and high unemployment. While I wouldn\u2019t ask you to stay away from such P2P platforms, you must understand it is a high risk investment. You must see if you have the requisite risk appetite.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we talk about borrowing money, the first name that clicks as a lender is a bank or a NBFC.
