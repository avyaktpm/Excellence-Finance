What should you do if you feel credit card utilization is affecting your credit score?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s try to find answers to these questions.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is Credit Card Utilization Ratio?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the name suggests, it simply shows how much of your available credit card limit you have utilized.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, let\u2019s assume your available credit card limit is Rs 2 lacs and your outstanding as on statement date is Rs 80,000, your credit utilization (ratio) is 40%.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, this credit utilization ratio is one of the inputs used by credit bureaus to calculate your credit.\u00a0<\/span><strong>The lower the utilization, the better it is for your credit score.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since credit bureaus use proprietary techniques to evaluate your credit score, it may not be easy to pinpoint the exact weightage of this ratio in the score. Similarly, it is not explicitly specified what is a good credit utilization ratio.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From what I have read, it is recommended to keep<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.creditkarma.com\/credit-cards\/i\/credit-card-utilization-and-your-credit-score\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit utilization below 30%<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4351 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/credit_card_utilization.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"259\" \/><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>Why Should Higher Credit Utilization Affect Your Credit Score?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit bureaus try to assess the likelihood that you will repay a loan. And credit scores are a way to quantify that likelihood and make it easier to appreciate for bankers and people like you and me.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A lower score means the credit bureau thinks that you are less likely to repay the loan (as compared to someone with a high credit score).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your credit utilization levels are consistently high, it demonstrates that you have higher appetite for credit and more importantly that you are too dependent on credit.\u00a0<\/span><b>If your credit score has to represent your repayment ability, a higher credit utilization is clearly a negative.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would expect a more person with more debt (and greater dependence on debt) to have higher chances of default.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s not ignore adverse situations either. What if you lose your job? Since you are dependent on credit (or so the credit bureau feels), there is a good chance of default.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, having a high utilization ratio for a \u00a0month or so may not affect your score badly. However, a consistently high utilization level may not go down well with credit bureaus.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>If I pay my credit card bills on time, why should my high credit utilization be an issue?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might feel why credit utilization should be an issue if you pay your bills on time. You might also argue that the credit bureau can\u2019t assess your credit dependence without looking at your bank balance or your overall financial position. All this while, you were using credit card to enjoy card benefits and interest-free credit period. You could have easily swipe your debit card to make those payments (and not use credit card).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are right but the problem is that Credit Bureaus don\u2019t have that much information about you.\u00a0<\/span>You must understand <strong>the<\/strong> <b>credit bureaus do not have any information about your bank balance, your net worth etc.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The banks or the financial institutions do not share such information with the credit bureaus. <\/span><b>Only the information about your credit facilities (credit cards, loans) are shared with the bureaus.\u00a0<\/b><b>A credit bureau such as CIBIL calculates your credit score on the basis of this limited information it has.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, the credit bureaus arrive at your credit score simply by looking at information about your credit facilities. A credit bureau will look at your payment history, credit balance, types of credit, credit enquiries etc. to assess your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it does not have any other information about you, it can\u2019t possibly consider other financial information about you while calculating your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is possible that you are paying your bills in full and on time. However, your credit score may still be down since your credit utilization is consistently high.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This might sound strange but you wouldn\u2019t want credit bureaus to have all the financial information about you, would you?<\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h2>What Should I Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, check your scores on a regular basis. Now, there is a provision that you can download a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/check-your-free-credit-report-before-applying-for-a-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">free credit report<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> per credit bureau per calendar year. Use the facility to keep track of your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your score is low, look into the reasons. \u00a0If there are very genuine and overt reasons (defaults, late payments) for a poor credit score, try to improve your credit behaviour.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are errors in your credit report, you can raise a dispute with credit bureaus. At the same time, follow up with the concerned credit institutions to resolve the issue at the earliest.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that the reasons for a low score are not very evident. It is in such cases that you have to use judgement to understand what the real issue is. For instance, a high credit utilization is not a very obvious red signal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you figure out that your score is low because of potentially high credit utilization, you can take one of the following steps.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Ask your existing card provider to increase your credit limit.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0This will automatically bring the ratio down. This might be the easiest thing to do because the bank already has access to other information about you and a past relationship to bank upon to make that decision.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Apply for a new card.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This can be a problem if your credit score is quite low.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Use your credit card with discretion.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you want to increase limit or apply for a new card, you can perhaps use your debit card at some places to reduce utilization levels in your credit card. <\/span>I assume this is an option.<\/li>\n<li><b>Another trick could be to square a bulk of your credit card expenses before the statement date. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though I am not too sure of this, as I understand, the data is provided to credit bureaus on statement closing date basis. Therefore, even if you have used your credit card extensively but have paid off the outstanding (or a bulk of it) before the statement date, the credit bureau will get information as on statement date. Since you already settled most of the expenses, your credit card utilization ratio will be low.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your credit score plays an important role not just in determining whether your loan gets sanctioned but also in the interest rate you pay on your loan.\u00a0One of the major inputs during calculation of your credit score is your credit utilization ratio.\u00a0What is credit card utilization ratio and why should it affect your credit score?&hellip; <a class=\"excerpt-more btn btn-primary\" href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/why-credit-utilization-ratio-affects-your-credit-score\/\">Continue Reading <i class=\"fas fa-chevron-circle-right\"><\/i><\/span><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"jetpack_post_was_ever_published":false},"categories":[4],"tags":[37,52,172,36,237],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v20.1 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Why Credit Utilization Ratio Affects Your Credit Score?
