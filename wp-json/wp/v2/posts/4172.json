Let\u2019s find out more about the product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Does the Bajaj Finserv Flexi Loan Work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Think of it as a credit line. <\/span><b>You can withdraw\/borrow or repay as many times as you want.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The only limitation is that you should not breach the credit limit.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you get a loan sanction for Rs 10 lacs. You borrow\/withdraw Rs 6 lacs. Over the next few months, you repay the entire amount. Subsequently, you borrow another Rs 8 lacs from the same loan account.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Here are a few important features of the product:<\/b><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rate is charged on the amount withdrawn (and not on the sanctioned amount).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To keep the loan regular, you need to pay only the interest portion.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can repay\/pre-pay the principal separately whenever you want.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are no prepayment charges.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, the maximum loan tenure is 6 years. No such information on the website. That\u2019s my inference looking at the sample loan agreement.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>What Are the Beneficial Features?<\/h2>\n<p><b>You have liquidity at your disposal.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is fair to assume that withdrawals (once the loan is sanctioned) will be quite hassle free.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, since it is a credit line, you do not have to approach the credit institution every time you need the money (fresh loan\/withdrawal).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You get flexibility in loan repayment.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Under this product, you have an option to simply keep paying the interest. Principal can be paid as per your discretion. Now, this provides flexibility. If you are going for a personal loan to tide over short term cash flow mismatch, this can offer you much needed relief. You don\u2019t have to worry about high EMIs from the first month itself. By the way, something very similar happens in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-lic-policies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loans against LIC policies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sample this. Under a regular personal loan of Rs 10 lacs for 3 years at 15% p.a., you will have to pay an EMI of Rs 34,665. Under Bajaj Finserv Flexi Loan product, you need to pay interest-only EMI of only Rs 12,500 per month. Clearly, a much lower amount.\u00a0<\/span><b>However, you must understand, under the first method (a regular personal loan), your outstanding principal amount is going down every month. Nothing of such sort in Bajaj Finserv Loan. You will end up paying higher absolute interest amount in case of Bajaj Finserv Flexi Loan.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/oTu73S_HW_A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en-US&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Things You Must Watch out for before Signing up for Bajaj Finserv Flexi Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, many important pieces of information about the product is missing on the product page on Bajaj Finserv. More often than not, this is bad news for borrowers.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I do not want to indulge in speculation but there are still a few aspects that you should be mindful of before signing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bajaj Finserv Flexi Loan is, after all, a personal loan product. The rate of interest is likely to be quite high. A well made TV commercial does not change that.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are times when it is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/when-is-it-foolish-to-take-a-personal-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">foolish to take a personal loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Take such a loan only when needed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In another<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-JSgmu7yNEc\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the product by Bajaj Finserv, the quantum of credit line (loan amount) was linked to your credit score. Higher your credit rating\/score, higher the credit line you can get. Sounds fair.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest-only EMI sounds good and provides flexibility in loan repayment. However, at the same time, you end up paying more in terms of absolute interest.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/media.bajajfinserv.in\/media\/finance\/downloads\/salaried-personal-loan-agreement2.pdf\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sample loan agreement<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> makes mention of a <strong>Maintenance Charge<\/strong> for a flexi loan. As I understand, the charge is an absolute charge and not a percentage of your loan amount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every loan has a tenure. It is not that you can keep paying only the interest for eternity. You need to repay the principal amount before the loan tenure ends.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the product works like a credit line from which you can withdraw and repay as many times as you want, I read a<\/span> <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankbazaar.com\/showUserReviews-487866-BAJAJ_FINSERV-PERSONAL_LOAN.html\">customer complaint<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, in which he mentioned that the entire amount was disbursed upfront (and not based on his requirement). He also mentioned about high processing charges and a bundled insurance product sale. This may well be a complaint by a disgruntled customer. However, this is still something worth considering.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand the quantum of processing fee before you sign up. <\/span><b>A higher processing fee can add significantly to the overall cost.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><strong>Avoid if the company tries to sell an insurance plan along with the product.<\/strong> Will unnecessarily add to your overall cost of the loan.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you must go for a personal loan, do check out the interest rate from other players too and take a call accordingly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>What Are the Documents Needed?<\/h2>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><\/td>\n<td><b>Salaried Professional<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Self-Employed<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eligibility<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 25 and 55 years of age<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An employee of a multinational, public or a private company<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Residing one of the top 150 cities in the country<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between 25 to 66 years of age<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a business vintage of at least 3 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With business Income Tax returns filed for last 2 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the business previous year\u2019s turnover duly audited by a certified Chartered Accountant<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Documents needed<\/span><\/td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KYC Documents<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last 2 months salary slips<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salary account bank statement for the last three months<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Employee ID card<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<td>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KYC Documents<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business proof or certificate of business existence<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank account statement of last 1 month<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><em>Disclaimer<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: My assessment is based on the information on the product page\/sample loan agreement on the website.
