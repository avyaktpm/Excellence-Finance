However, those starting their professional careers or those who have just stepped out of college may not really be looking for such big-ticket loans. They may be looking for much smaller loans to purchase products for lifestyle, convenience and mobility.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let\u2019s look at a loan product that many young professionals may need. A loan to purchase a two-wheeler or a bike.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will pick up a couple of two-wheeler loan products from HDFC Bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>HDFC Bank Two-Wheeler Loan: Features and Loan Eligibility<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Loan Amount: Rs 20,000.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount: Rs 1.5 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flexibility to select loan tenure from 12 months to 48 months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are an existing HDFC Bank account holder, you can get up to 100% finance on select models.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2% lower interest rate and 50% waiver on processing fee for existing HDFC Bank account holders.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be salaried or self-employed. Well, you must have a source of income.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum age at entry: 21 years, maximum age at loan completion: 65 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Gross annual income of Rs 72,000 for salaried and Rs 84,000 for self-employed.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be working for at least 1 year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be staying in your current residence for at least 1 year. In case of a transfer, you will have to produce supporting documents.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must either have landline connection at home or office.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can apply for this loan online or through HDFC Bank branches or at the time of purchase through partner dealerships.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also check your loan eligibility by entering your details on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/two-wheeler-loan\/features\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC bank website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>HDFC Bank: Super Bike Loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank has another two-wheeler loan product. As I understand, this loan product is to purchase more expensive bikes. There is not much info about the product on the bank website. However, as I see, the eligibility should be the same as for regular two-wheeler loan product.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan of up to 85% of the value of the bike.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can even avail funding of Rs 2 lacs for accessories. Must be an expensive bike.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maximum loan amount is not mentioned. However, given that you can get a funding of Rs 2 lacs for accessories, the maximum loan amount must be quite high (as compared to regular two-wheeler loan variant).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, since the loan is for more expensive bikes, the loan will be given to borrowers with income above a certain threshold (or else repayment will be a problem).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>HDFC Bank Two-Wheeler Loan: Interest Rate<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current interest rate for the regular two-wheeler loan mentioned on the HDFC Bank website ranges for 11.61% to 22.37% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rate of interest mentioned for <\/span>Super Bike<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> two-wheeler loan ranges from 9% to 13.26% p.a. I am not sure why the rate for super bike loan should be lower. It is possible that this loan is offered only to borrowers with high creditworthiness, which is the reason for low interest rates.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though nothing is mentioned on the website, the rate of interest should depend on your creditworthiness. The rate may depend on your monthly income, credit score and the amount of loan (cost of the two-wheeler).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, you get a 2% interest rate discount if you are an existing bank customer.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note that rate of interest keeps changing. Check with the bank for the prevailing rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you can see, the rate of interest is not very generous. <\/span><b>If the rate of two-wheeler loan is quite high, you may even consider a personal loan. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a personal loan, you may get funding for the entire loan amount and you don\u2019t have to worry about provide security either. The issue is that it is not easy to get a personal loan (since the loan is unsecured). In fact, for someone who is fresh out of college, a personal loan may not even be an option.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Other Charges?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing fee is quite high at 3% of the loan amount. By the way, 3% is the maximum. This charge may be subject to negotiation. As mentioned earlier, existing HDFC Bank customers will get a discount of 50% on the processing fees.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, documentation charges will be a maximum of 3% of the loan amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC bank charges prepayment penalty too, as follows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepayment is not allowed in the first 3 months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10% of principal outstanding if you prepay within 4 to 6 months of 1<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> EMI.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">6% of principal outstanding if you prepay within 7 to 12 months of 1<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> EMI.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4% of principal outstanding if you prepay within 13 to 24 months of 1<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">st<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> EMI.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post 24 months, 3% of principal outstanding.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">GST is applicable on all the charges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do You Have to Provide Any Security?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two-wheeler will be hypothecated to the bank. And this should suffice.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if the bank is not very comfortable with your repayment ability, it may ask for additional security or insist on a guarantor.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Documents Are Needed to Apply for Bike (Two-Wheeler) Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will have to provide identity and address proof. In addition, you have to provide income proof too. Salaried can provide salary slips while the self-employed can provide the latest income tax return copy.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the complete list of the documents, please refer to the documentation page for<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/two-wheeler-loan\/documentation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank Two-wheeler loan page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The documentation requirement (and eligibility for the HDFC Bank Super Bike Loan may be a bit stringent.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/super-bike-loan\/documentation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The document list for Super Bike loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> includes repayment record. By the way, I am not sure what this means.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you must purchase a bike with a loan, go ahead. Just ensure that you can pay EMIs on time. When you are fresh out of college, it is not easy to get hang of your expenses. Almost every lifestyle product or a fresh fashion label seems indispensable. You don\u2019t want to commit a big portion of your income towards your two-wheeler EMI. Be prudent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider options from other banks and NBFCs and figure out the product the lowest cost and charges and high flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Additional Reading<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/two-wheeler-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank Two-wheeler loan page<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/super-bike-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank Super Bike loan page<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/personal-banking\/2-wheeler-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI Two-wheeler loan page<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In many of our earlier posts, we have considered big ticket loans (car loans, home loans etc).
