At the sales counter, you notice an offer of taking a loan for the purchase amount at 4%. You get excited. After all, you get a higher rate of interest in a fixed deposit. It makes for a nice arbitrage opportunity.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s understand such offers with the help of an example.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You purchase an item worth Rs 1 lac. You take loan for the purchase amount and you need to repay Rs 1.04 lacs (At an advertised rate of 4%) over the next 12 months. You need to pay 12 EMIs of Rs 8,667 each (Rs 1.04 lacs\/12). Fair enough.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In absolute terms, it appears that the cost of loan is 4% p.a. However, we also need to look at the timing of cash flows and the other costs involved.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the cost of the loan really 4%? No, it is not. The cost of the loan is much higher.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>First EMI is adjusted with the amount itself.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lender adjusts the first EMI with the loan amount itself. In a way, you pay the first EMI at the time of availing loan itself.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are taking a loan of Rs 91,333 (Rs 1 lac \u2013 Rs 8,667) and returning Rs. 95,333 (Rs 1.04 \u2013 Rs 8,667).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This takes the cost of loan to 4.38%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Don\u2019t ignore the processing fee (and the service tax). <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the processing fee is 1% of the purchase amount, you have to incur those charges too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, processing fee is adjusted with the loan amount. Hence, your effective loan amount will go down further.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And don\u2019t forget about the service tax.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 1%, loan processing fee is Rs 1,000. Add service tax of Rs 150 (at 15%).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, while taking the loan, you will pay Rs 9,817 upfront (Rs 1 lac \u2013 Rs 8,667 \u2013 Rs 1,000 \u2013 Rs 150) and you take the loan for the remaining amount (Rs 90,183).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a loan of Rs 90,183, you have to repay Rs 95,333.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the cost is 5.71%.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Pay attention to the timing of loan repayment.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were to repay the entire loan at the end of the year, the cost of the loan would have actually been around 5.7% p.a. However, that\u2019s not the case.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a reducing balance EMI schedule. A portion of every EMI goes towards interest payment while the remaining goes towards principal repayment.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the first EMI was adjusted with the loan amount, you have only 11 months to repay the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the loan amount of Rs 90,183 and 11 EMIs of 8,667, the cost of the loan is actually 11.25% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not convinced, here is the proof. At interest rate of 11.25% p.a., the outstanding principal becomes Nil at the end of 11 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"3\"><b>Interest Rate<\/b><\/td>\n<td

cost is not 4% p.a. or 5.7% p.a. but 11.25% per annum. This happened because you didn\u2019t just pay interest at the end of the year, but in all the EMIs. \u00a0Another way to look at it \u2014 you did not get to use the full Rs 1 lac amount for 12 months. Your outstanding principal kept reducing with each payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Points to Note<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will get such offers only from NBFCs (non-banking finance companies). As I understand, banks are<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8461&amp;Mode=0\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">prohibited<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the Reserve Bank to indulge in such tricks.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost to you is the return to the lender with minor adjustments. Service tax on processing fee does not go to the lender. That will bring down the return. However if the lender has negotiated a discount (on the product) with the dealer, the return to the lender will be much higher than 11.25% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, even though the products cost Rs 1 lac to you, the lender makes a payment of only Rs 97,500 to the dealer. The return to the lender is 16.69% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Should You Do about Such Schemes?<\/h3>\n<p>You need to dig deeper before you opt for such schemes.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The effective cost of such loans is much higher than the advertised rate. I have considered an advertised cost of 4%. You can break down any such offer in a spreadsheet and calculate the effective cost.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, if you have the funds to make the purchase outright, make the outright payment. Why do you want to incur cost of 11.25% p.a.?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if you don\u2019t have the requisite funds and still need to make the purchase?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In that case, at 11.25% p.a., the cost of the loan may be lower than the interest rate for personal loan. Hence, if you cannot afford the entire purchase cost, it may be an option worth considering.\u00a0<\/span>Do note 11.25% p.a. is the cost of loan for advertised cost of 4% and processing fee of 1%. If you change the inputs, the effective cost of loan will change.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, such offers can be structured in many different ways. However, you can easily break down the cost components in a spreadsheet and calculate the effective cost for decision making.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Read<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/capitalmind.in\/2016\/11\/suckered-how-a-4-loan-for-furniture-actually-costs-you-12\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capital Mind: How a 4% loan for furniture costs you 12%?<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/the-curious-case-of-0-emi-schemes\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Curious Case of 0% EMI schemes<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/why-did-rbi-ban-0-emi-schemes\/\">Why did RBI ban 0% EMI schemes?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You purchase your favourite gadget\/furniture.
