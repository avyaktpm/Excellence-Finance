I am talking about loan against a car that you already own. In this post, let\u2019s discuss a loan against car product from HDFC Bank. Other banks and NBFCs have similar loan features and eligibility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>HDFC Bank Loan against Car: Eligibility and Salient Features<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum annual income: Rs 2.5 lacs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both salaried and self-employed can apply<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Salaried<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Minimum age 21 years, should be working for at least 2 years and a minimum of 1 year with current employer<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Self-employed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Minimum age 31 years, should be running the business for a minimum of 3 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Car fleet owners can also apply<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get a loan against a car that has been financed by a loan from HDFC bank or from any other lender. <\/span>If your lender is different, you will have to transfer your existing loan to HDFC Bank. This may entail some cost<\/li>\n<li><b>The car should not be more than 5 years old at the time of loan application<\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan is available against all kinds of hatchbacks and sedans (except for some out of production models). You will have to check with your nearest HDFC Bank branch<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can read the eligibility criteria in detail on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/car-loans\/loan-against-car\/eligbilty-criteria\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Much Loan Can I Get?<\/h2>\n<p><b>The loan amount will depend on the market value of your car. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though not explicitly stated, the model and make of your car, car usage and the reputation of car model may also play a role.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the exact LTV is not clearly defined on the website, it is reasonable to expect that loan amount will not exceed 70-80% of the car value.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have an existing loan on car, you can deduct your outstanding amount from your loan eligibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your car is financed by HDFC Bank, there may be verification\/valuation depending upon your credit requirement. Clearly, if the loan amount is bigger, the bank may turn a bit cautious. By the way, if your car is already hypothecated to HDFC bank, the loan disbursal can be quite quick.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it has been financed by another lender, you will have to go through a valuation exercise.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>As I understand, if the car is not purchased on loan, you cannot apply for this loan against car.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is because you need to submit record of repayment of car loan for the last 9 months. You can\u2019t have a repayment record if you do not have a car loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you can think of this loan as more of a top-up car loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Do You Need to Provide Additional Security?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No. There is no need to provide additional security or arrange for a guarantor. The car itself is the security.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What Are the Documents Required to Avail This Loan?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to provide KYC documents and legal documents of your car. You can get the complete list<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/car-loans\/loan-against-car\/documentation\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Loan Tenure for Loans against Car?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tenure can vary across lenders. At the same time, the age of your car can also limit the loan tenure.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tenure for loan at HDFC Bank ranges from 12 to 60 months. However, at the time of loan maturity, the age of the vehicle should not exceed 7 years for private vehicles and 6 years for commercial vehicles.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if your car is 4 years old, the loan tenure cannot exceed 3 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Rate of Interest? What Are the Other Charges?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest rate (as mentioned on the HDFC Bank website) ranges from 14% p.a. to 16 p.a. The rate depends on the age and segment of the vehicle.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The interest rate appears to be on the higher side. You may be able to avail a personal loan at a lower rate. However, the interest rate data on less popular products may not always be updated.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing fee is 1.5% of the loan amount subject to a minimum of Rs 2,500 and a maximum of Rs 5,000. Foreclosure is not allowed within 6 months of disbursal. Prepayment penalty ranges from 3% to 6% depending upon when you prepay the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the complete list of charges, you can visit<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/car-loans\/loan-against-car\/rates-fees\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on HDFC Bank website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Benefit of Loan against Car?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a secured loan. Therefore, you can expect the loan interest rate to be lower as compared to a personal loan. That is the biggest advantage.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, it is easier to get a secured loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, you could have sold your car to arrange funds. Subsequently, you could have purchased a second hand or a new car after some time (when the mini financial crisis was over).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, by opting for this loan, you can continue to use the car and use it to raise the funds. You may need a car to maintain your life style or continue your business.\u00a0<\/span><b>In terms of utility, even a 5 year old car may have the same utility as a new car (even though a new car is way more expensive).<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> That\u2019s true, at least for me. However, if you were to sell your old car to arrange funds and try to own a car again later, you may have to shell out a lot more.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Flip Side?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is interest cost. There is processing fee. There is heavy prepayment penalty.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, as with any loan, it is not wise to take a loan if you can\u2019t repay it. If you can\u2019t repay the loan, the bank will take possession of the car.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you need to think through these aspects before you sign up for this product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Additional Reading<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/faq\/faq-inner\/gts8minu-gts8mipa-gts8mipe\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Bank Car Loans: FAQs<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/car-loan\/loan-against-car\/features-benefits\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank: Loan against Car<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bajajfinserv.in\/loan-against-car\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bajaj Finserv: Loan against Car<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have discussed several ways of raising funds in times of need.
