In this post, let\u2019s extend this argument to a car.<\/p>\n<p>Wait, what, a car? Yes, instead of buying a car, you can rent a car.<\/p>\n<p>You buy a new car on loan. You pay EMIs for 3-5 years and for insurance and maintenance every year. Car loan EMIs, insurance, and maintenance are almost fixed costs. There will be small variation over the years, but you can be reasonably sure about the outgo. Once the loan is over, you own the car.<\/p>\n<p>Alternatively, subscribe to a monthly rental program. Drive home a brand new car. Pay monthly rent as long as you use the car. Then, return the car. Monthly rent takes care of insurance and maintenance.<\/p>\n<p>In both cases, you have a monthly outgo, and you bear the fuel cost.<\/p>\n<p><b>Paying the car loan EMI vs Monthly rent? <\/b>In a depreciating asset such as a car, which option is a better choice?<\/p>\n<h2>Maruti Suzuki Subscribe<\/h2>\n<p>Maruti Suzuki offers cars on subscription basis under<strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.marutisuzuki.com\/subscribe\">Maruti Suzuki Subscribe<\/a><\/strong> program.

EMI for a loan of Rs 8.23 lacs = <b>Rs 20,873.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>We have looked at the cost of insurance. Beyond the first year, let\u2019s say you will pay 25,000 per annum for insurance and maintenance. Given the cost of insurance I showed above, even this annual cost is on the higher side.<\/p>\n<p>So, Rs 20,873 per month in the first year.<\/p>\n<p>And Rs 20,873 + 25,000\/12 per month = Rs 22,956 per month in the next 3 years.<\/p>\n<p>Under the rental plan, you paid Rs 17,416.<\/p>\n<p><b>Thus, over the next 4 years, you will pay Rs 2.53 lacs extra if you buy the car outright.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>However, you will own the car, which you can sell. Let\u2019s say you can sell the car at 50% of the purchase price. <b>You get about Rs 4 lacs on selling the car.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>So, you pay Rs 2.53 lacs extra over the next 4 years and you own an asset worth Rs 4 lacs.<\/b> I don\u2019t want to go into XIRR calculations here. <b>However, looking at the numbers, buying a car looks a better option than renting (or leasing) the car.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Beyond the 4th year, if you own the car, you can continue to use the car at no extra payments to the bank.<\/p>\n<p>If you are renting\/leasing, you need to subscribe to a new plan, which has a substantial cost. Or you have an option to buy back the car, but you can\u2019t be sure of the buyback price.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Note<\/b>: I have done this analysis just for Maruti Suzuki Swift Vxi MT. If you are keen on a different car, go to the Subscribe page and check out the rental for your preferred car. Thereafter, you can compare against buying the car on loan.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Merits in Renting or Maruti Suzuki Subscribe Plan<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>No hassles. Pick up a car and subscribe.<\/li>\n<li>At the end of the subscription period, you can extend the subscription. OR Upgrade\/downgrade to another car. OR buy back the car.<\/li>\n<li>Good option if you are shifting to a new city for just a few months or a couple of years. When you move to a different city, let go of the existing subscription and take a new subscription in the new city. And get a brand new car.<\/li>\n<li>Quite beneficial if you are shifting to a different state. If you own a car, you will have to transfer Vehicle registration to the new state and pay road tax. If you don\u2019t do that, local cops can sometimes harass you. No such problems with the Subscription model.<\/li>\n<li>No down payment needed.<\/li>\n<li>If you are self-employed, you can even show subscription rental as an expense.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Demerits in Maruti Suzuki Subscribe Plan<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You will never know the full picture until you subscribe.<\/li>\n<li>Product brochures always present a rosy picture. There may be details in the fine print that might cause trouble later.<\/li>\n<li>There is a lock-in period. What if you want to end the subscription in between? What shall be the penalty amount?<\/li>\n<li>There is a cap on the maximum usage. The maximum is 25,000 kms per year. If you are a heavy user, you must pay for every extra kilometer driven. If you owned the car, you wouldn\u2019t have to pay for extra usage.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p>If we consider the numbers above, buying seems like a better option than renting. However, these decisions are not just mathematical.<\/p>\n<p>Your situation may warrant a different decision. Everyone is wired differently. Some may prefer buying while the others might prefer renting or leasing. For instance, if I needed a car for just a couple of years, I wouldn\u2019t want to go through the hassles of buying and selling. Might just rent\/lease the car.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a heavy user, then buying is clearly a better option. You may breach the cap of annual distance quite easily and then pay through the nose for extra usage.<\/p>\n<p><b>What do you prefer for your next car?
