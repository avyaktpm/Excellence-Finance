An interesting thing about the new card was the it permitted<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.visa.co.in\/pay-with-visa\/featured-technologies\/visa-paywave.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">contactless transactions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Call me paranoid but I was not very comfortable with the contactless feature. I asked the bank to switch off the feature but the bank declined. The bank said they couldn\u2019t do it and went into the usual rant about how I could approach them if a fraudulent transaction were to take place. I left it at that, disappointed though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the banks can\u2019t deny such requests. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reserve Bank of India has issued a circular \u201c<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11788&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enhancing Security of Card Transactions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201d on January 15, 2020. <\/span><b>The circular applies to both credit cards and debit cards<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The circular comes into force on March 16, 2020. The provisions of the circular do not apply to prepaid cards. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the key highlights of the circular.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#1<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At the time of issue\/re-issue, the credit or debit card shall <\/span><strong>only be enabled for use at contact based points of usage (ATMs and Point of Sale devices) within India<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means that your card won\u2019t be enabled for online transactions, international transactions or contactless transactions by default. You must explicitly request your bank to permit such transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#2<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Based on risk perception, the banks can decide to disable your card for online transactions (both domestic and international), physical\/offline transactions (international) and contactless transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#3<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The <\/span><strong>existing cards (those issued before March 16, 2020) shall be mandatorily disabled<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for online transactions, international transactions (physical\/offline) and contactless transactions if you have never used the card for such a purpose. This is a very good move, although it can cause operational hassle sometimes. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you have never used your card for online transactions, it will be automatically disabled for online transactions.\u00a0 You will have to request you bank to enable it if you want to use such a card for online transactions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, if you have not used a card for international transactions, you will have to request your bank to enable it before you swipe it abroad. The process of international transactions is the same even now. Currently, you must inform the bank of your travel or else the transactions abroad are usually not accepted. The banks do it to prevent frauds. Now, this is a regulatory requirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>#4<\/strong> The banks must now provide the <strong>facility to switch on\/off and set\/modify transaction limits<\/strong> (within the overall transaction limit for all types of transactions i.e. domestic\/international\/ATM\/ PoS\/online\/contactless transactions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your credit limit may be Rs 1 lacs but now you can set your PoS transaction limit at 10,000 and online transaction limit at Rs 5,000. You can even disable it for certain types of transactions. For instance, if you wish, you can disable your card for online or contactless or international transactions. A few banks already do that. However, with these regulations, every bank must now offer this facility mandatorily. A very good move indeed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#5<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This facility to switch on\/off and modify transaction limits shall be available 24X7 through multiple channels including mobile apps, internet banking\/ ATMs\/ IVR. The bank may (not mandatory) offer this service at its branches\/offices too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>#6<\/strong> You will receive an alert\/information\/status through SMS and e-mail, whenever there is a change in status of the card.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Do I Think?<\/h2>\n<p><b>This is a very customer-friendly regulation. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banking frauds (both online and physical) are on the rise. Many times, these frauds happen on inactive accounts or cards. Since the default option is to disable the card for most types of transactions, such frauds can be prevented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even for those who use their credit or debit cards frequently, these regulations will go a long way in reducing such frauds and also the impact of such frauds even if a fraud were to happen. For instance, you now have option to cap transaction size for online transactions or even disable it. Therefore, you can simply disable online transactions or keep the transaction limit very low. When you need to use such a card for online transaction, you can temporarily increase the limit and reset it back to default (or disable) once the transaction is done. You will be able to do it using the bank mobile app.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>My current credit card expired recently and I was issued a fresh card by the bank.
