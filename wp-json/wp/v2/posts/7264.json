We are not used to seeing home loans of 40-year tenure. Before this, the maximum I had heard was 30 years. So, that\u2019s a sharp jump. I don\u2019t want to go into specifics of home loan products from Bajaj Housing Finance. Loans are a commodity and there is little to differentiate between any two home loan products.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, I want to focus on the loan tenure of 40 years.

That\u2019s longer than more people would be gainfully employed in their whole lives. That\u2019s also the reason why 40-year home loans are not common. As I understand, Bajaj Housing Finance will consider other aspects such as your age and work profile before assigning you the maximum loan tenure. Not everyone would get a loan tenure of 40 years. For you to find out from Bajaj Housing Finance.<\/p>\n<p>There are no right or wrong answers. Nobody wants to take out a home loan for a very long tenure. It is a cash outgo after all. It is the circumstances that force you.<\/p>\n<p>In my opinion, the principal repayment (without any prepayments) for the 40-year is too slow. Hence, this deal will make me a bit edgy. Almost as good as paying house rent. Note that house rent is what you pay to the house owner and the interest is the rent you pay to the bank. However, the good part with home loans is that you can prepay and reduce the tenure of the loan aggressively.<\/p>\n<p>I trust your judgement.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bajaj Housing Finance has extended the tenure of its home loan products for new borrowers up to a maximum of 40 years.
