style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I got a few enquiries about the EMI moratorium math. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">For instance, you are stopping EMIs for only 3 months. A Rs 50 lacs loan at 9% p.a. with remaining tenure of 15 years (case 3) will accrue interest of only Rs 1.13 lacs during these 3 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How does that increase my EMIs from 180 months to 189 months (EMI remains constant)? Why do you have to pay <strong>Rs 4.51 lacs extra<\/strong> for just 3 months of reprieve?<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the tenure is kept constant at 180 months, EMI increases by 1,150 from Rs 50,713 to Rs 51,863. Multiply that by 180 months and you have an excess payment of <strong>Rs. 2.07 lacs extra<\/strong> over the original schedule.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why this difference in excess payment in the two forms of adjustments? i.e., EMI unchanged (Opt #1) and Loan tenure unchanged (Opt #2). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/with-loans-the-power-of-compounding-works-in-reverse\/\">That&#8217;s the power of compounding for you. Just that it is in reverse.<\/a> And the one that harms you.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use Excel functions like PMT and NPER or the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to get all the answers. I had discussed \u201cHow Loan EMIs are calculated and work?\u201d in an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-emi-calculation-work\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a>. Still, is there a simpler way to understand this?<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s approach this problem from a different angle. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you don\u2019t pay EMI for 3 months, the outstanding principal grows to Rs 51.13 lacs (50 lacs * (1+9%\/12)^3), after adding the interest for the three months to the original outstanding principal of Rs 50 lacs. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s divide this loan amount of Rs 51.13 lacs into two parts:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An Original loan of Rs 50 lacs and<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A New Loan of Rs 1.13 lacs (Rs 1,13,346 to be precise).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>EMI kept constant, but the Tenure is changed<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The original EMI of Rs 50,713 is enough to square off the original loan of Rs 50 lacs in 180 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the EMI remains constant, you can assume that the two loans will be repaid in succession. First, the Original Loan is paid off in 180 months. Subsequently, the EMI goes towards settling the New loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, the New Loan shouldn\u2019t sit quietly while pay off the Original Loan. Should it? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will continue to grow in size due to accrued interest. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the 180 months, the second loan grows to 1.13 lacs * (1+9%\/12)^180 = Rs 4.35 lacs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the original loan is paid, the EMI of Rs 50,713 can go towards the repayment of this loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you have a loan of Rs 4.35 lacs, EMI of Rs 50,713 and interest rate of 9% p.a. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many months does it take to repay this loan? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to find this. <\/span><b>You will get an answer of about 9 months. <\/b>Matches exactly, doesn\u2019t it?<\/p>\n<h3><b>Tenure kept constant, but the EMI is changed<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this case, you will have to pay an additional EMI for the New Loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will be the EMI for Rs 1.13 lacs loan for 180 months and an interest rate of 9% p.a.? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can again use the loan calculator to find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EMI for the New Loan shall be Rs. 1,149.63.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the loan tenure is constant, this EMI runs simultaneously.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Total EMI to be paid per month <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>= EMI for the Original Loan + EMI for the new loan <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">= 50, 713 + 1,149.63 = Rs. 51,863<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, everything matches.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Why the difference between the two cases?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the first case (EMI constant), you don\u2019t pay the New Loan for 15 years. And that adds to the interest cost and your eventual payout.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the second case (Tenure constant), you pay the EMI for the New Loan from the first month. This keeps the interest cost in check.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note, in both the cases, the cost of the loan remains the same, i.e. 9% p.a. The difference lies in only the absolute cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong><i class=\"fas fa-paperclip\"><\/i> <a title=\"SBI MaxGain Excel\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1OsA2f-2bMcramFRHn3eBBVtrfUyVxZc8edaQDFKqT74\/copy?usp=sharing\">RBI Moratorium Excel &#8211; Excess Payment Calculation<\/a><\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>22-May\u00a0Update \u2014 RBI has extended EMI moratorium on all term loans by another 3 months till 31-August-2020.
