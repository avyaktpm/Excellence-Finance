And we could see how rates of return along with the power of compounding can result in vastly different amount at the end of your investment term.<\/li>\n<li>The third example was to show how your money\/currency gradually loses value over a period of time. Inflation will be around irrespective of what you do. In fact, if you see, inflation is also an example of compounding. Just that it works against you. i.e., it is adding to your misery.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now the question is how do you counter inflation?\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Frankly, there is nothing you can do to stop inflation. It will be there.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you can and you must ensure that your money retains it purchasing power.\u00a0<\/span>And how do you do that? You can do that by investing your money. Take cues from our second example (doubling the money).\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were to invest your Rs 100 in an investment that gives you 10% p.a. compounded returns, you will have Rs 214.4 at the end of 8 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Rs. 100 X (1.10)^8 = Rs 214.4<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That is just about the money you need to purchase 10 apples after 8 years.\u00a0This way, you have been able to keep the purchasing power of your money intact.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you could invest in an investment that gives you 12% p.a. you would have Rs 247 at the end of 8 years. Good enough for you to buy 11.5 apples. In this case, your money has grown faster than inflation and you have been able to beat inflation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>When it comes to investments, the compounding works in your favour.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, when it comes to inflation, you don\u2019t have a choice. You deal with what you get.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of investments, you have a choice.
