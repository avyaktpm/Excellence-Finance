You have 3 loans running and a bit of credit card debt.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Home loan of Rs 20 lacs (Remaining Tenure: 17 years, Rate: 8% p.a., EMI: Rs 18,000)<\/li>\n<li>Personal loan of 5 lacs (Remaining Tenure: 3 years, Rate: 13% p.a., EMI: Rs 17,000)<\/li>\n<li>Personal Loan: Rs 59,000 (Remaining Tenure: 8 months, Rate: 16% p.a., EMI: ~ Rs 8,000)<\/li>\n<li>Credit Card outstanding of Rs 27,000<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>What would you do? Retain cash in the bank OR prepay expensive loans? <strong>The choice is simple, isn\u2019t it?<\/strong> Just pay off the high interest cost loans. Therefore, pay off the credit card debt and personal loan of 59,000. And reduce outstanding in Rs 5 lac loan. Retain the home loan since the interest cost is low and you also get tax benefit.<\/p>\n<p><b>Well, not always.<\/b> In personal finance, the context changes everything.<\/p>\n<p>Let us fill in a few details. The Covid pandemic has been harsh on you. <strong>You have lost your job and are still trying a find a new one.<\/strong> Clearly, the cash inflows in the near future seem uncertain. You got this Rs 4 lacs from a few friends who offered to help.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What do you think you really need in such a case? Optimization or a longer rope?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>If you are looking for optimization, prepaying an expensive loan is an excellent choice.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>However,<b> if you are looking for a longer rope, then conserving cash may be a better choice. <\/b>Rather than square off the loans, you can simply continue with the EMIs and let them close naturally, at least until you find a new job.<\/p>\n<h2>Doing Math for Various What-if Scenarios<\/h2>\n<p><b>Let\u2019s assume, in all the scenarios, we will square off the credit card debt.<\/b> We do this because the amount is small and seems manageable (again contextual). Additionally, credit card debt is just too expensive. High interest and various penalties would compound the outstanding very fast.<\/p>\n<p>We are left with Rs 4 lacs \u2013 Rs 27,000 = <b>Rs 3.73 lacs<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>We are left with 3 loans now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We won\u2019t prepay the home loan either. The interest rate is low, and you get tax benefits too.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So, we are left with Rs 3.73 lacs and two personal loans.<\/p>\n<h3>Scenario 1<\/h3>\n<p><b>We do not pay off any of the loans.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Total EMI = Rs 18,000 (home loan) + 17,000 (personal loan 1) + 8,000 (personal loan 2) = 43,000<\/p>\n<p>Your monthly expenses are Rs 25,000.<\/p>\n<p>Total monthly outgo = 43,000 + 25,000 = 68,000<\/p>\n<p>So, we have cash for Rs 3.73 lacs \/ 68,000 = <b>5.5 months<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Scenario 2<\/h3>\n<p><strong>You pay off the personal loan (2) of Rs 59,000.<\/strong> Your cash is down to Rs 3.14 lacs, but there is one less EMI to pay.<\/p>\n<p>Total EMI = Rs 18,000 (home loan) + Rs 17,000 (personal loan 1) = Rs 35,000.<\/p>\n<p>Total monthly expenses = Rs 35,000 + Rs 25,000 = Rs 60,000<\/p>\n<p>You have cash for Rs 3.14 lacs \/ 60,000 = <b>5.23 months<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Not much difference from Scenario 1. You have cash for 1 week less (though you will have a lower loan liability at the end of the period). This is still fine.<\/p>\n<h3>Scenario 3<\/h3>\n<p><strong>You pay off the personal loan (2) of Rs 59,000. <\/strong><b>Additionally, you pay Rs 2 lacs of personal loan 1. <\/b>Further, you request the bank to reduce the EMI. Note that the default mode is reduction in tenure (and not in EMI).<\/p>\n<p>EMI for personal loan goes down from Rs 17,000 to Rs 10,108. Awesome.<\/p>\n<p>Your cash position goes down to Rs 1.14 lacs.<\/p>\n<p>Total EMI = Rs 18,000 (home loan) + Rs 10,108 (personal loan1) = Rs 28,108. Awesome again.<\/p>\n<p>Total monthly outgo = Rs 28,108 + 25,000 (regular expenses) = Rs 53,108<\/p>\n<p>Now, you have cash for Rs 1.14 lacs \/ 53,108 =<b> 2.15 months<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You can see, in Scenarios and 2 and 3, you have lower loan outstanding and lower EMIs than Scenario 1. At the same time, you have a shorter rope too.<\/p>\n<p>In scenario 3, you will run out of cash in just a couple of months. If you don\u2019t find a job by then, how will you manage your monthly expenses? And you will default on your loan EMIs after this period too. Yes, Scenarios 2 and 3 seem more optimal since you are paying off expensive loans. However, for a person who is still seeking a job, Scenario 1 may be a better choice. In such cases, you need a longer rope. By the way, Scenario 2 is not too bad either.<\/p>\n<h2>There Could Be Friction<\/h2>\n<p>Personal loans prepayment usually involves a penalty. And an expensive personal loan will likely have a higher prepayment penalty.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume the Rs 59,000 personal loan had a prepayment penalty of 4% of the prepayment amount. Hence, if you foreclose the loan, you will have to pay a penalty of Rs 2,784 (incl. GST).<\/p>\n<p>Total outgo for prepayment = Rs 59,000 + Rs 2,784 = Rs 61,784<\/p>\n<p>Had you simply continued with the EMIs, you would have paid a total of Rs 62,594 over the next 8 months. Hence, you do not really save much on the cashflow front.<\/p>\n<h2>And Things Can Go Wrong<\/h2>\n<p>In the above illustrations, we did these calculations on excel. What about unplanned expenses? What if you must spend Rs 50,000 on medical treatment? This reduces the cash buffer by a few weeks. What if you had the buffer only for 8 weeks (Scenario 3)? Complicates matters even further. Remember it is not easy to get fresh loans when you are out of job. In such a specific case, a bigger cash buffer (not prepaying loans) buys you time to find a job and handle unplanned expenses.<\/p>\n<h2>Finally, What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p>There is no right or wrong answer. And we don\u2019t have to go with just one approach (no prepayment or full prepayment). We could use a mix and match approach. As I said, everything depends on the context. Your cash flow position, quantum of cash and loan outstanding, expenses etc. However, now we know that, at least in a few cases, retaining cash might be better than prepaying a loan at 13 or 15% p.a.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You have Rs 4 lacs in your bank account.
