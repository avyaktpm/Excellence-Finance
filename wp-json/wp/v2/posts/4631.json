If nothing else, you can apply for a personal loan. On the other hand, once you have retired, your ability to take a loan from the formal finance sector goes down. However, the need for a loan does not go away even after you retire. There are events which might force you to take a loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are retired, what are your loan options? Not many.

Therefore, the absolute cap is Rs 10 lacs.\u00a0<\/span>Your monthly pension is Rs 20,000.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This means your pension loan EMI cannot exceed Rs 10,000 per month. If the loan tenure is 5 years, this implies that the maximum loan amount can be only Rs 4.7 lacs. i.e., EMI for a loan of Rs 4.7 lacs at 10% p.a. for 5 years will be Rs 10,000.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the maximum EMI is Rs 10,000, the maximum loan amount automatically gets capped at Rs 4.7 lacs. You can try out<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-calculator\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to assess maximum loan amount for your case.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you may not get even Rs 4.7 lacs. As mentioned earlier, the loan amount is also capped at 18 times your monthly pension. Therefore, the maximum loan amount in this will be 18 X 20,000 = 3.6 lacs (and not Rs 4.7 lacs).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a loan of Rs 3.6 lacs for 5 years at 10% p.a., the loan EMI will be Rs 7,649.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>Do You Need to Provide Any Security?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no tangible security required. However, the guarantee for spouse (eligible for family pension) is required.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, guarantee from earning children (preferably Government employees) will also do.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also provide a third-party guarantee for the loan amount.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The requirements are quite similar to those for SBI pension loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are Rates of Interest and Other Charges for PNB Pension Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand interest rate and charges can change over a period of time.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As on December 19, 2018, the interest rate for pension loan is 1-year MCLR + 2.8%. 1-year MCLR is 8.5% p.a. Therefore, the effective rate of interest will be 11.3% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no processing fee. Rs 500 will be charged towards documentation charges.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can check the latest<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbindia.in\/interst-rate-on-advances-linked-to-mclr.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">interest rate<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbindia.in\/service-charges-related-to-retail-advances.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">charges<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on PNB website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Points to Note<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was no mention of loan for family pensioners on PNB website.
