This is clearly to give a push to home buyers, especially those who are sitting on the fence.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Immense Relief for Buyers of Electric Vehicles<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an additional tax deduction of Rs 1.5 lacs for the interest paid towards a loan taken to purchase an electric vehicle (under Section 80EEB). As I understand, vehicle includes both bikes and cars.\u00a0 By the way, the finance bill has a definition for the electric vehicle. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax relief is subject to the following conditions:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The vehicle must be purchased between April 1, 2019 and March 31, 2023.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan must be taken from a financial institution.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tax relief is not just limited to the year of purchase but shall be available in the subsequent years too. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Again, the Government wants to promote electric vehicle. GST on such vehicles has also been reduced from 12% to 5%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Additional Important Announcements in the Budget<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government shall launch a CPSE ETF that will get you tax benefits under Section 80C just like you do for ELSS (Equity linked savings scheme). The Government uses CPSE ETFs for its divestment in PSUs. The modalities are still awaited.
