All the eligible borrowers across the banks\/financial institutions got this relief. However, the nature of relief under the loan resolution\/restructuring scheme will vary across banks. Your bank will decide what it offers you. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intent of any restructuring (or resolution) schemes is to make loan repayment easier for the borrower. The relief (as offered by the bank) can come in the form of moratorium on loan repayments or lower EMIs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, there is no free lunch. The banks won\u2019t waive off your loan. <\/span><b>And any relief (in any form) will have a cost attached.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There might be a hike in interest rate. Or in case of moratorium, the unpaid interest will be added to your principal and increase your future EMI. In case of extension in loan tenure, you must pay the EMI for a longer duration. <\/span><b>Net result: Your overall outgo towards the loan repayment increases.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the borrowers can still seek recourse under such schemes to avoid defaulting on their loans. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out more about Loan Resolution Framework 2.0.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who Is Eligible for Loan Resolution Framework 2.0?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The borrowers (individuals, small business and MSMEs) with aggregate exposure of up to Rs 25 crores are eligible. The borrowings across the banking and financial services industry shall be considered. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, following conditions must be met:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Must NOT have availed restructuring under any of the earlier restructuring frameworks, including<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-moratorium-out-loan-resolution-in\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Resolution framework 1.0 (dated August 6, 2020)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><b>AND<\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan account is classified as \u201cStandard\u201d as on March 31, 2021.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>There is an exception to condition (1). <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For individual borrowers, who had availed relief under Resolution Framework 1.0 but the moratorium availed was less than 2 years, such borrowers can seek relief under this Resolution Framework 2.0 and get moratorium extended to 2 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The rest of the conditions shall be the same as for <\/b><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-moratorium-out-loan-resolution-in\/\"><b>Resolution framework 1.0<\/b><\/a><b>.\u00a0<\/b><b>The restructuring can be invoked until September 30, 2021.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The date of invocation is the date when the borrower and the lender agree to the resolution plan. The implementation must be completed within 90 days of invocation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Banks Have a Lot of Discretion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike EMI moratorium (that was offered from March 1, 2020 until August 31, 2020), the banks\/financial institutions have a lot of discretion. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Copying an excerpt from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11941\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI Resolution Framework 1.0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (the conditions are the same for Framework 2.0).<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The resolution plans may inter alia include rescheduling of payments, conversion of any interest accrued, or to be accrued, into another credit facility, or, granting of moratorium, based on an assessment of income streams of the borrower, subject to a maximum of two years. Correspondingly, the overall tenor of the loan may also get modified commensurately. The moratorium period, if granted, shall come into force immediately upon implementation of the resolution plan.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the banks can extend the loan tenure by up to 2 years. They can decide the quantum of moratorium (up to 2 years). They can decide whether the moratorium is both on interest or principal or both. They can change the principal repayment schedule. They can charge a processing fee. They can hike the interest for restructured loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discussed the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/sbi-loan-restructuring-scheme-how-does-it-work-what-is-the-impact\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI Loan Restructuring scheme under framework 1.0<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You could choose between the two options:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMI moratorium of upto 24 months (no EMI to be paid)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extension of loan tenure by 2 years (longer tenure means lower EMI)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under both the options, the loan interest rate increases by 0.35% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any restructuring you seek will add to your costs. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your bank increases the interest rate, the cost of loan goes up. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your bank allows moratorium, the unpaid interest will accrue and add to the outstanding principal. Higher principal means higher interest outgo. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bank can allow a moratorium and hike the loan interest rate too. Double whammy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike RBI EMI moratorium scheme (March 1 to August 31, 2021), there is no explicit protection from damage to credit score. Your loans will be reported as \u201cRestructured\u201d to the credit bureaus and this will impact your credit score adversely. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, this is not the time for fancy excel calculations. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to look at your cashflows. <\/span><b>If you worry that your cashflows may not be sufficient to meet loan EMI payments, it is better to seek relief under this scheme. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0You do not want to default on your loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reach out to your bank and understand what they are offering. Make an informed decision.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the second Covid wave impacting lives and livelihoods, the Reserve Bank of India has made an attempt to provide relief to troubled borrowers.
