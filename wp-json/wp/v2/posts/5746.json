How do you answer this question? <strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">A) <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; background-color: #ffffaa;\">Rs 50 lacs for 15 years<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\"> OR <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">B) <\/span><\/span><\/strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; background-color: #ffffaa;\">EMI of Rs 47,782 per month for 15 years?<\/span><\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both have the same meaning. If you track your loan amount properly, you will answer in terms of the outstanding principal amount. However, when it comes to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-much-home-loan-emi-can-you-afford\/\">affordability<\/a>, managing your cashflows and mental accounting, you will likely think of your loan in terms of an EMI.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I read an interesting article on EMIs in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneylife.in\/article\/the-emi-rigmarole-pushing-customers-into-the-debt-trap\/62203.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MoneyLife<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, While I agree with the author on many points about EMIs, the article seemed to give an impression that EMIs are bad.\u00a0 That\u2019s where I beg to differ with the author.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why Are EMIs Bad?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a borrower, you entail an additional cost of interest, especially during the initial years of your loan tenure when a big portion of your monthly installment goes towards interest payment and very little goes towards principal repayment. In one of the posts on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/pay-rent-to-the-owner-or-rent-to-the-bank\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rent vs. Buy<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, we called interest as Rent of money borrowed. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the costs are never good.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>More importantly, access to easy credit may push up your tendency to overspend.<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You may undertake expenses that you wouldn\u2019t normally take in the absence of access to credit. For instance, you can buy a Rs 20,000 phone by paying upfront. Or you can buy an Rs 50,000 phone by paying Rs 4,500 per month for 12 months. You choose the latter option. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am no one to suggest what kind of phone you must buy. However, if both the phones meet your configuration and lifestyle requirements and you do not have unlimited resources, is it wise to buy an expensive phone just because you have easy credit available?<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And this irresponsible spending behaviour can be a problem. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The EMIs may be comfortable today. However, in case of job loss or salary cut, the EMIs may cease to be comfortable. Or if you are forced to take a loan (say in case of a medical emergency), the total EMI may breach your comfortable zone. If such shocks are not handled well, you can get into a debt trap.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Are All EMIs Bad? Is All Debt Bad?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, borrowing is not a problem per se. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, irresponsible credit behaviour and frivolous spending can be land you in trouble, but you cannot term all EMIs bad. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, access to credit can be extremely useful. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>To a <\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>responsible borrower, loans are a good way to gradually accumulate assets and get to your desired standard of living.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying a house by paying Rs 50 lacs upfront looks a gargantuan task for many of us. However, taking ownership of that house by paying Rs 47,000 per month for the next 20 years does not sound as difficult and seems within reach. An own house may give a sense of financial and emotional security to the family. How do you account for this in a spreadsheet?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may not have Rs 5 lacs with you to buy a car. Rs 10,500 per month for 5 years seems possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask any corporate finance person. Debt is a good way to fund massive projects (assets), provided those assets turn out to be productive and repay debt through cashflows generated. The same debt becomes a problem if the asset can\u2019t repay debt. This is because the debt must be repaid, irrespective of whether the asset yields sufficient cashflows. Therefore, while taking on more debt enhances return on equity (and should be considered favourable for shareholders), higher leverage also means higher risk.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Individuals are not too different. Responsible borrowing can be helpful. Too much debt can harm both individuals and companies.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Is Saving up an Option?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common refrain is that you should save up instead of going for a loan. For instance, instead of going for a loan, you save for a few years and use the money. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Makes sense. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is OK if you buy a house at the age of 50 rather than at the age of 40. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, can you do this for everything? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can the higher education of your kids wait for 3 years? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Would you pursue a degree or certification to enhance your career prospects now or after 2 years? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need a car to commute your elderly parents to hospital every week? Would you save up for 2 years or buy a car on loan? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many have not been seeking services of domestic help since the pandemic began. Is it a bad idea to buy a dishwasher on a No-cost EMI (provided you can afford it)? <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Hence, saving up may not be always be option. You may have to go for a loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Practice Responsible Borrowing<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, there is nothing wrong with EMIs per se. The problem lies in borrowing (and spending) irresponsibly and not planning for exigencies in life. <\/span>Here is what you need to do.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>Do not\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>over-borrow<\/b>. <\/span><b>Do not borrow just because you can.<\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Limit your borrowing as a percentage of your net monthly income. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact percentage but 35-40% of net take-home pay is a reasonable upper threshold if you are servicing a home loan EMI. Without a home loan EMI, this number should be much lower.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, after providing for EMIs, you just don\u2019t have to fund monthly expenses but also invest for your future.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>Take loans only for building assets (home loan), value additive activities (education loan) or necessities (car purchase as in example discussed earlier).<\/strong><\/span> Please understand this is not an exhaustive list.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">Avoid loans for lifestyle expenses (expensive gadgets or vacations). It is in such cases where thinking of loans in terms of EMIs can be a bad idea<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">.<\/span><\/strong> In most such cases, better to save up and then spend.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t trust your luck too much. <strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/things-can-go-wrong-accept-and-plan-for-it\/\">Things will go wrong.<\/a> Be prepared. <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/why-do-you-need-an-emergency-corpus\/\">Build a robust emergency fund<\/a>.<\/span><\/strong> In case of pay cuts or job loss, this will come in handy.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>Related Reading:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/financial-habits-that-can-spoil-your-future\/\">Financial Habits That Can Spoil Your Future<\/a><\/strong><\/h4>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How much debt do you have?
