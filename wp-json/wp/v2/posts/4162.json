And it is not just for ornamental purposes. Many use it for investment too. It is an asset they think they can always rely upon in case of any needs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fair enough.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/gold-loan-unlocking-cash-for-emergency-needs\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post on gold loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I had discussed how you can use your gold to take out a quick loan. Gold loans are short term loans, with most banks and financial institutions limited to tenure of 12 months.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, I will discuss various features of gold loan product from Axis Bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How to apply for Axis Bank Gold Loan?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to visit the Axis Bank Branch with your gold\/jewellery and the requisite documents. I am not sure if the gold loan facility will be available at all the branches in India. Axis Bank has provided the list of such branches on the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/gold-loan\/faqs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">FAQ page for the loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you can apply for the loan online or by calling up the customer care, I believe it will still require a visit to the branch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Documents Required to Apply for Axis Bank Gold Loan?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the bank website, you need to provide (along with gold) the following documents:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signed application form<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Photographs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ID proof, Address Proof and Signature proof<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PAN Card (Form 60 if you don\u2019t have the PAN card)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Age Proof<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Post-disbursement documents, if any<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can see the bank has not sought any information about your income. Frankly, they don\u2019t need to. They have your gold (as security). In addition, the gold loans are short term and have an upper cap of Loan-to-value ratio of 75%. This should take care of both loan repayment and volatility in gold prices.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Who can apply for the Gold Loan?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone aged between 18 to 75 yeaRs <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What are the maximum and minimum loan amount?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum amount is Rs 25,001 and the maximum loan amount is Rs 20 lacs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How much loan can I get under Axis Bank Gold Loan scheme and what is the loan tenure?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, it depends on the value of gold that you are willing to put as collateral.\u00a0<\/span>RBI, in its<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=9124&amp;Mode=0\"> circular dated July 22, 2014<\/a>, has capped the Loan-to-Value ratio for gold loans at 75%. This is applicable for all gold loans.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand the bank or gold loan NBFCs can always choose a lower LTV due to their credit guidelines. <\/span>There is no mention of LTV on Axis Bank Gold loan page.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank FAQ page also mentions verifying your repayment ability. However, if you check the documentation requirement, they have not asked for any income related documents (salary slips, Income Tax returns etc).\u00a0<\/span>As per bank website, you can avail gold loan for tenure ranging from 6 to 36 months.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Tenure for bullet repayment loans is capped at 12 months (as per aforementioned RBI circular).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What rate of gold shall be considered?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=8701&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI circular dated January 20, 2014<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, security (gold) has to be valued at the average of closing price of 22 carat gold for the preceding 30 days as quoted by Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association Limited. If the gold is of lesser purity, the gold shall be valued proportionately.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank does not mention about the gold valuation technique used. It is fair to assume that they will comply with RBI guidelines. <\/span>If the bank wants to offer you lesser loan amount, it can always consider a lower LTV.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interestingly, the aforesaid RBI circular does not mention higher purity gold (i.e. 24 carat gold). Will you be eligible for a higher loan amount if you have 24 carat gold (mostly in form of gold coins)? I am not sure. No information about this on Axis Bank website either. However, on the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.icicibank.com\/calculators\/gold-loan-eligibilty-calculator.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICICI Bank Gold loan eligibility calculator<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it shows a higher value for 24 carat gold.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Can I get loan against Gold Coins too?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, you can take loan against gold coins too. However, the maximum limit is 50gms (for gold coins) per customer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the loan interest rate on offer?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Currently, Axis Bank is offering loans at 14.5% to 17% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What are the charges other than the loan interest rate?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will have to pay processing fee of 1% of the loan amount. In addition, there are valuation charges of Rs 500. As per the bank website, there are no charges for loan foreclosure or part prepayment. Minimum pre-payment amount is Rs 10,000.\u00a0<\/span>If you are late on payments, be prepared to pay penalty of 2% per month.<b>\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the charges are subject to GST.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the updated list of charges, please refer to the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/gold-loan\/fees-charges\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fee and charges page for the gold loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Different Options for Loan Repayment?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank provides you three options under its Gold Loan Scheme.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monthly interest payment and principal repayment on maturity date\u00a0(bullet repayment)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Upfront interest payment and principal repayment on maturity date<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMI option (both interest and principal are paid on a monthly basis)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>As I understand, the tenure under the first and second option will be capped at 12 months.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For third method, the tenure can be higher.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, as per RBI circular dated July 22, 2014, for the purpose of calculation of LTV, the credit institution must consider accrued interest too. Therefore, it is quite possible that loan eligibility may also be lower under the second method.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, on the FAQ page, it is mentioned that the bank calculates <\/span>only simple interest (and not compound interest) for all loans<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In such a case, I believe the rate of interest may be different for the three kinds of repayment methods. Clearly, the quoted rate of interest will be the highest for the first payment method.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>How quickly can I access the loan?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where gold loans fare quite well. If you have the gold and the documentation ready, you should get the loan quite quickly.

With a short loan tenure, I believe there is not much scope for innovation. To be honest, you should always be wary of innovation in loan products.\u00a0<\/span><b>Focus on the loan eligibility, interest rates and flexibility in repayment\/prepayment. Since there could be multiple repayment options, you need to look beyond the quoted interest rate for comparison.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, don\u2019t ignore your repayment ability. Unlike home loans, it is fairly easy for the banks to dispose off your gold. i.e., it is quite easy to sell. Since the loan is short term, you need to see if you can repay the loan. Your monthly cash flows may not improve in a year. Penal interest for late payments is quite high too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the repayment ability is in doubt, it may be a better idea to sell the gold\/jewellery rather than taking loan against it. At least, you will save on the interest amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Disclaimer\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have relied on the information available on the bank website for this post. It is quite possible that the information may not be updated or my assessment of the information shared may be incorrect. Therefore, before making a commitment, you are advised to call up customer or visit the nearest bank branch to understand the gold loan product better. \u00a0<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Information<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/gold-loan\/features-benefits\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank Gold Loan Home page<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/gold-loan\/faqs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank Gold Loan FAQ<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Most Indians have a fondness for gold.
