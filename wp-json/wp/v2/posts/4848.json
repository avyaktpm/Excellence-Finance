That feature is moratorium on interest payments. On home loans, you get a moratorium on principal repayments (Pre-EMI) and not interest payments. Interest must be paid on time. Even for corporate loans, moratorium is typically only for principal repayments. And there is good rationale behind such moratorium on interest payments in education loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When the borrower is studying (and not working), there is little chance that he will have money to make any kind of loan payments. Therefore, the bank waits for the borrower to finish his\/her studies, find a job and then start paying the loan. The flip side is that the interest keeps getting accrued to the outstanding principal. When you finally start paying loan EMIs, you figure out that the loan outstanding is much larger than the amount you got from the bank (discussed later). Now, this can be a problem for students from Economically Weaker Sections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order that such students do not feel the pinch of accrued interest the Central Government had started Central Sector Subsidy Scheme in 2009. Under this, the Central Government takes care of the interest during the moratorium period. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let\u2019s find out more about the Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme (CSIS) for education loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Central Sector Interest Subsidy Scheme (CSIS): Eligibility<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The student must belong to an Economically Weaker Section. Parental income should be lower than Rs 4.5 lacs per annum.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For students enrolled in professional \/ technical courses from institutions<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accredited by<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.naac.gov.in\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NAAC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (National Assessment and Accreditation Council) OR<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accredited by NBA or institutions of national importance or Centrally funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) OR<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other professional institutions approved by respective regulatory body such as Medical Council of India, Dental Council of India, Indian Nursing Council, Bar Council of India etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get subsidy just once. Therefore, you can either avail subsidy benefit for undergraduate course or for post-graduate course. You can\u2019t avail for both. You can avail subsidy if you have enrolled for an integrated program (undergraduate and post-graduate),<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education loan must be taken under IBA (Indian Banks Association) Model Education Loan Scheme. IBA Model Loan Scheme is nothing complex but a simple education loan structure that the banks abide by. For instance, moratorium period under an IBA model loan is Course Period + 1 year. For more on IBA guidelines on Model Education Loan, refer to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.iba.org.in\/pdf\/education\/Model_Edu_loan.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this document<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, there is no cap on the eligible loan amount. However, the subsidy shall be extended only for the maximum of Rs 10 lacs. For instance, if you take a loan of Rs 15 lacs, you will get interest rate subsidy for only Rs 10 lacs. For the excess Rs 5 lacs, there won\u2019t be any interest subsidy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Central Sector Interest Subsidy (CSIS) Works?<\/h2>\n<p><b>You get interest subsidy during the moratorium period.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under education loan, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/education-loan-or-a-personal-loan-what-to-choose\/\">students get moratorium on loan repayments<\/a>. As per IBA model education loan, the moratorium is for Course Period +1 year. However, the interest during the period keeps getting added to the outstanding amount. For instance, if your course duration is 4 years, you will get moratorium for 5 years (4 years + 1 year). During this period, you do not have to pay anything to the bank, but the interest keeps accumulating and gets added to the outstanding principal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you take a loan of Rs 2 lacs (let\u2019s say everything is upfront) and the rate of interest is 10% p.a., your loan outstanding would grow to Rs 3 lacs in 5 years. <\/span><b>Only simple interest (and not compound interest) is charged during the moratorium period and this interest gets accrued to the outstanding principal. At the end of 5 years, the EMI will be calculated on Rs 3 lacs.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are eligible for the subsidy scheme, then the interest during the moratorium period will be taken care of by the Government. Since the Government pays the interest to the bank during the moratorium period, your loan outstanding will remain the same at Rs 2 lacs (and not grow to Rs 3 lacs) at the end of 5 years. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a very substantial cost-saving for the education loan borrowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest subsidy under the scheme shall not be extended to students who discontinue their course midway or those who are expelled from the institution on disciplinary or academic grounds. However, interest subsidy will be available if the studies have been discontinued due to medical reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Once the moratorium period gets over, the interest will be to be borne by the borrower.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>How to Apply for the Subsidy?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can apply for the subsidy while making your loan application. Since there is upper cap on the parental income, you are required to furnish an income proof from the authorised public authority of the State Government. You can furnish this proof to the concerned bank branch. If you are using<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/vidya-lakshmi-portal-a-single-window-electronic-platform-to-apply-for-education-loan-from-multiple-banks\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VidyaLakshmi portal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make your education loan application, you can apply for subsidy from the website too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Additional Reading<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/mhrd.gov.in\/sites\/upload_files\/mhrd\/files\/upload_document\/CSIS%20-%20NewGuidelines.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central Sector Subsidy Scheme (CSIS) Guidelines<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canarabank.com\/english\/bank-services\/priority-portal\/interest-subsidy-educational-loans\/csis-faq\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Canara Bank CSIS FAQs<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/student-platform\/interest-subsidy\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education Loan Interest Subsidy page on State Bank of India website<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Education loans have a unique feature.
