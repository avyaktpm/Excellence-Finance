The scheme was launched in 2015 to promote funding for green-field projects promoted by SC\/ST\/Women entrepreneurs. The scheme facilitates bank loans between Rs 10 lakhs and Rs 1 crore.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out more about the loan scheme.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Stand up India Loan Scheme: Eligibility<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The loan is available to only women borrowers or to Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) Borrowers.<\/li>\n<li>You must be above 18 years of age.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan must be used to set up a greenfield enterprise. i.e., this must be the first venture of the borrower.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>The enterprise should be in manufacturing, services or trading sector.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the applicant is a non-individual (say a company), at least 51% of the shareholding or the controlling stake must be owned by the SC\/ST or woman entrepreneur.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Borrower shouldn\u2019t be in default with any bank or financial institution.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if a lady has done beautician course and wants to open a beauty parlour. She can apply for loan under the scheme provided she meets the other conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>How Much Loan Can I Get under Stand up India Loan Scheme?\u00a0<\/strong>The loan amount under the scheme ranges from Rs 10 lacs to Rs 1 crore.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If the borrower has taken both term loan and working capital loan, the cap of Rs 1 crore is on the cumulative loan amount.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan scheme would fund only 75% of the project cost. This means, 25% of the project cost still needs to be managed.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the scheme, the borrower must bring 10% of the project cost from own funds. To bridge the deficit, he\/she can seek assistance under eligible state\/central schemes. Here are a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/Home\/SubsidySchemesForAll\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">few subsidy schemes<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that can be taken advantage of.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Working capital loans up to Rs 10 lacs can be sanctioned as overdraft. Rupay debit card shall also be issued. For working capital loans in excess of Rs 10 lacs, the facility must be sanctioned as cash credit limit.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if my loan requirement is less than Rs 10 lacs?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such cases, you must apply for loan under the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/mudra-loan-small-businesses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mudra loan scheme<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>What Is the rate of interest for such Loans?\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government has not specified any rate of interest. The rate must be the lowest that is offered for the borrower category (where the applicant falls).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government has specified a cap though. The rate of interest for such loans must not exceed Base\/MCLR + 3% +Tenure premium.\u00a0<\/span>I believe this is likely to be very good rate for any first-time entrepreneur.<\/p>\n<p><b>What is the repayment tenure for Stand Up India Loans?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maximum loan tenure is 7 years. The bank may provide you moratorium on principal repayment for up to 18 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What is the security for such loans?\u00a0<\/b>Banks or financial institutions will have charge on the assets created from such loans.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In case of term loans, the concerned bank will have first charge on the fixed asset (say, machinery) created through the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a working capital loan, the bank will create charge on the current assets (raw material, finished goods, receivables etc) created through such facility.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though not relevant for the borrowers, the bank may seek guarantee from Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme too.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How to Apply for Stand up India Loans?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can apply for Stand Up India Loans in many ways. Do ensure that you meet the eligibility criteria.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the branches of Scheduled and Commercial Banks<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through Stand Up India Portal (<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the lead district manager (LDM)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online process is quite similar to that in case of<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/mudra-loan-small-businesses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mudra Loans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The application process is succinctly explained in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/Home\/ForApplicants\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this video<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on StandUpMitra website.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on your initial application inputs, the system will decide if you are a trainee borrower or a ready borrower.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a ready borrower, you can go ahead and complete the application form.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a trainee borrower, then you will be provided hand-holding support during the application process.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>If you are wondering what is the difference between Stand Up India and Mudra loans, the difference is in eligibility and the maximum loan amount. Under Mudra Loan scheme, the maximum loan amount is capped at Rs 10 lacs. With Stand Up India loan, the minimum loan amount is Rs 10 lacs. I expect the loan sanction process under Mudra loans to be relatively lenient.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>How long does it take to get such loans approved?\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the scheme guidelines, the loan shall be approved by concerned branch within 3-6 weeks of completed application. Actual timelines may vary.\u00a0<\/span>Please understand there is no guarantee that your loan application under this scheme will be approved<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Banks will do necessary diligence before sanctioning the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Links<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/Home\/FAQs\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand Up India FAQs<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.standupmitra.in\/Home\/SchemeGuidelines\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand Up India Scheme Guidelines<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.icicibank.com\/Personal-Banking\/loans\/stand-up-india-scheme.page\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICICI Bank Stand Up India Loan Page<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The Stand Up India scheme is aimed at promoting entrepreneurship at the grassroots sections of the society.
