EMIs of all your existing loans, along with potential EMI for this loan, will be considered for the purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>For the overdraft facility<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the drawing power (DP) will be reduced on monthly basis so that the DP becomes NIL in 60 months. The quantum of reduction in DP every month is not defined. Clearly, it does not work like a regular overdraft account. If you have utilized the complete limit, you need to make payment every month because the DP for the next month will be lower.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you exceed the DP limit, be prepared to pay the penal interest.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Who Is Eligible for Such Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a bit tricky.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per SBI website, the loan is <strong>available to only those who maintain <\/strong><\/span><strong>salary account with SBI<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and work with one of the following entities.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central \/ State Government<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quasi-Government<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Central PSUs and Profit making State PSUs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Educational Institutes of national repute<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Select Corporates that have business relationship with the bank<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank may consider employees from other corporates too, subject to a few terms and conditions<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you need to be a salaried employee with select corporate or institution to enjoy this loan facility.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I see, if you do not meet this criteria, you will not get loan under this facility.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Flexibility of a Second Loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI provides you the facility to take out a second Xpress Credit Loan while you are still repaying the first one provided:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least one year has passed since the first loan was disbursed<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have been regular in making payments for the first loan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other conditions including maximum EMI\/NMI ratio of 50% still apply<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there cannot be more than 2 outstanding Xpress Credit personal loans in the name of the same borrower.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, here is an interesting aspect.\u00a0<\/span><b>SBI will not charge any prepayment penalty if the loan account is closed from the proceeds of a new Xpress Credit Personal loan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> So, you can use this feature to your advantage in an interest rate downcycle (or shrink in spread over MCLR).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s assume you took a loan of Rs 5 lacs at 14% p.a. After a couple of years, the interest rate for the loan scheme has gone down to say 11% p.a. You can take out a second Xpress Credit Loan for the outstanding amount and prepay the first loan. You will <\/span><b>NOT<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> have to pay any prepayment charges of 3%.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, do note you will have to pay processing fee of 1% of the loan amount for the second loan. There may be other minor ancillary charges. This will, in a way, negate the benefit of avoiding prepayment charges. So, work out a few numbers before you take out a second loan to prepay the first loan and benefit from downward movement in interest rates (or shrink in spread over MCLR).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is good that you have such flexibility at your disposal.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, if you take out loan from any other bank or any other loan scheme from SBI to prepay your existing Xpress Credit Loan, prepayment charges will be applicable.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Interest Rate and Your Credit Score<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I had discussed, in an earlier<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/your-credit-score-will-determine-your-home-loan-emi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, about the ever-increasing role your credit score can play in determining the interest rate of your loans. And here you have it. SBI, for its personal loan, is now giving loans different interest rates based on your credit score. Clearly, higher the credit score, lower the interest rate you have to pay.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, do check out your credit score before applying for the loan.
