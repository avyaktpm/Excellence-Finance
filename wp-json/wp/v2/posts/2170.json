The RBI just announced a repo rate cut by quarter per cent (0.25 per cent) and this is likely to result in loans becoming marginally cheaper. The reduction in repo rate will make borrowing from RBI cheaper for banks and the banks are expected to pass this benefit on to their customers. At present, interest rates across banks average around 10.50 per cent for home loans, 11.25 per cent for car loans, and over 18.50 per cent for personal loans. <a title=\"IDBI Bank and NHB cut lending rates\" href=\"http:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/idbi-bank-cuts-lending-deposit-rates-by-025_814942.html\" target=\"_blank\">National Housing Bank, IDBI Bank<\/a> and <a title=\"RBS reduce rates\" href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/business\/Industry\/idbi-bank-rbs-reduce-rates\/article4357906.ece\" target=\"_blank\">RBS<\/a> have already announced rate cuts following RBI\u2019s announcement.<br \/>\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\" src=\"\/\/ajax.googleapis.com\/ajax\/static\/modules\/gviz\/1.0\/chart.js\">\/\/ <![CDATA[\n{\"dataSourceUrl\":\"\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheet\/tq?key=0Ared8Eic2tJbdDhqeTcwSWMyVTVpZl9KbWE5SXNWNnc&#038;transpose=0&#038;headers=1&#038;range=A1%3AB60&#038;gid=0&#038;pub=1\",\"options\":{\"titleTextStyle\":{\"fontSize\":16},\"displayAnnotations\":true,\"min\":null,\"max\":null,\"allValuesSuffix\":\"\",\"animation\":{\"duration\":0},\"width\":568,\"fill\":null,\"displayRangeSelector\":true,\"hAxis\":{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"Horizontal axis title\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},\"wmode\":\"opaque\",\"vAxes\":[{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"title\":\"Left vertical axis title\",\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null},{\"useFormatFromData\":true,\"minValue\":null,\"viewWindow\":{\"min\":null,\"max\":null},\"maxValue\":null}],\"booleanRole\":\"certainty\",\"title\":\"Chart title\",\"height\":464,\"scaleType\":\"maximize\",\"legend\":\"right\",\"thickness\":\"1\",\"dateFormat\":\"dd\/MM\/yyyy\"},\"state\":{},\"view\":{},\"chartType\":\"AnnotatedTimeLine\",\"chartName\":\"Chart 1\"}\n\/\/ ]]><\/script><br \/>\nThe <a title=\"RBI notification\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=7833&amp;Mode=0\" target=\"_blank\">RBI in its notification<\/a>, stated that the change in its monetary policy is intended to support growth by providing an appropriate interest rate environment; further, it intended to curb inflation and ensure sufficient flow of funds to the productive sectors of economy.<\/p>\n<p>In its third quarter review, RBI announced the following policy measures:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reduction in repo rate by 25 basis points i.e., from 8.0 per cent to 7.75 per cent with immediate effect<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Reverse repo rate adjusted to 6.75 per cent with immediate effect<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Bank rate adjusted to 8.75 per cent<\/li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">Reducing Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) to 4.0 per cent effective fortnight beginning February 9, 2013<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The <a title=\"RBI's rate cut will help investment\" href=\"http:\/\/in.news.yahoo.com\/rbis-rate-cut-help-investment-ahluwalia-055022477--business.html;_ylt=Agv9gTzZrNj2KY.O6zbmcTPWscB_;_ylu=X3oDMTRpNzA0MWEwBG1pdANNaXhlZCBMaXN0IExhdGVzdCBBcnRpY2xlcwRwa2cDNjZiNDZjNmUtMjA4My0zMWQzLTljYWUtMWRlNGQwNjYxNjM5BHBvcwM1BHNlYwNNZWRpYUJMaXN0TWl4ZWRMUENBVGVtcAR2ZXIDMTU2ZTRhNDEtNjlkYi0xMWUyLTlkYTctZGI5NzJiNzVkMmNl;_ylg=X3oDMTJqOTU0cmliBGludGwDaW4EbGFuZwNlbi1pbgRwc3RhaWQDNTY5MGExYjAtOGU1ZC0zMTI2LWI2NmEtNjRmYmM3NGJiN2I2BHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdl;_ylv=3\" target=\"_blank\">industry experts opine<\/a> that , this rate cut combined with reduction in CRR will help the investment and spur economic growth.
