We discussed one such scheme<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/stand-up-india-loan-for-sc-st-or-women-entrepreneurs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stand up India<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in an earlier post. Under the scheme, women entrepreneurs can take loans up to Rs 1 crore. The loans under Stand up India scheme can be availed from any of the scheduled and commercial banks.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Stand up India is a scheme promoted by the Government of India and almost all banks will offer loans under the scheme (at least on paper), certain banks have launched special products for businesswomen. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let us look at Nari Shakti Loan, a loan product from the Union Bank of India aimed at businesswomen.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Union Nari Shakti Loan: Eligibility<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For micro and small enterprises managed by women.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a partnership concern, the majority of the partners shall be women. In case of a company, the majority of the directors shall be women. As I understand, the majority controlling stake should be held by women.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Both existing and new borrowers can be covered under this product.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum credit rating requirement: For new loans, minimum credit rating should be UBI-5. For takeover loans, the minimum credit rating should be UBI-4. These ratings are internal to Union Bank of India. You can find out more about these ratings<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unionbankofindia.co.in\/English\/msme-credit-credit-rating-procedure.aspx\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 For quick reference, UBI-1 is a better rating than UBI-5.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available both as Cash credit and term loan. Also available as a composite loan (mix of term loan and working capital loan)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Loan Amount and Loan Tenure<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan amount can range from Rs 2 lacs to Rs 1 crores.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan tenure depends on the type of loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>For working capital facility<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: 1 year. As I understand, working capital or cash credit facility will have to be renewed every year.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>For Term Loans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Up to 7 years. This can include moratorium of up to a maximum of 12 months.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Margin Requirement\/Security\/Collateral<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank must safeguard its interest. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank achieves this by specifying a margin requirement, creating a charge on funded assets, by asking the borrower to bring in collateral or by asking the borrower to furnish a personal guarantee.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Margin Requirement<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the amount that the borrower must manage from own funds while taking a loan. For instance, if the project cost is Rs 50 lacs and the margin is 10%, the borrower must bring Rs 5 lacs from own funds while the bank will provide the finance for the remaining Rs 45 lacs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For loans up to Rs 10 lacs, there is a margin requirement of 5%. For loans more than 10 lacs, margin requirement is 15%.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Creating Charge\/Security<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a working capital loan\/facility, the bank will create a charge on current assets. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of a term loan, the bank will create exclusive charge on the assets created out of the bank loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Asking for Collateral<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No collateral is needed:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For loans up to Rs 10 lacs,<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the loan is up to Rs 1 crore and is covered under<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cgtmse.in\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CGTMSE (Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, the borrower needs to pay a fee for such guarantee.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the loan is NOT covered under CGTMSE and is greater than 10 lacs, then the borrower must furnish collateral of up to 25% for working capital loan and 15% for other loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><b>Guarantee<\/b><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal guarantee of proprietor \/ partners \/ directors. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal guarantee of property owner which has been offered and accepted as collateral. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can be painful.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Rate of Interest?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan interest rate depends on the credit profile of the borrower. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the product page on Union Bank website.
