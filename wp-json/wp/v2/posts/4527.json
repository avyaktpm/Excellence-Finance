In flat interest rate loans, the interest is calculated on the initial (entire) loan amount. Under reducing balance loans, the interest is charged only on the outstanding amount.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using IRR function in excel, you can figure out the effective cost of loan for a flat interest rate loan. This cost can then be compared to reducing balance interest rate for the loan in India.\u00a0<\/span><b>The flat interest rate at 4% (for the loan described above) is equivalent to 7.42% under reducing balance loan.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have discussed the difference betw<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">een the two methods with examples in an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/beware-if-you-are-offered-loan-at-too-attractive-an-interest-rate\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I checked out a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yallacompare.com\/uae\/en\/personal-loans\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan comparison portal in UAE<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.

However,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/when-is-it-foolish-to-take-a-personal-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">taking a loan abroad to invest in equity markets in India should be avoided<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rupee depreciation can also be problem if you eventually want to take money back to the foreign country.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, not everything is so gloomy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many NRI borrowers take a loan at a lower cost abroad and send that money to India for investments or asset purchases (<\/span>replacement for a rupee loan<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). However, instead of relying of the cashflows from the investment made in India, <\/span><b>they use their local income (in foreign currency) to repay the loan.\u00a0<\/b><b>This is a better approach in my opinion.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, since you know that you have to repay your local cashflows, there may be a lower tendency to overborrow. Secondly, this approach takes care of the exchange rate fluctuations to quite an extent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least your loan repayment does not get complicated due to rupee depreciation. That your investment can lose value due to rupee depreciation is another matter.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you had to leave your job abroad or your income abroad gets compromised in any manner, then even this approach can cause you trouble.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Look at Processing Fee and the Other Ancillary Charges<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have seen in an <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/what-is-the-real-cost-of-your-loan\/\">earlier post<\/a> how processing fee and other loan charges can affect your cost of loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have taken a loan abroad to make an investment, these charges will increase the cost of loan and will have a direct impact on net returns.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, if you have taken a loan to replace a rupee loan (that you would have taken), you need to account for such charges while assessing and comparing the all-in-cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#4 There Will Be Currency Conversion Charges<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to incur cost in sending money to India. The bank will charge commission on the conversion. The banks typically charge a spread on the market rates. This also adds to the cost of loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have to take this money back abroad, you will have to incur this cost twice.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note there would be no such cost if you were to take a rupee loan in India.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Consider the Impact of Tax-Breaks You Would Lose out On<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unlikely that you will get a tax benefit for repayment of personal loan abroad.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you were to take a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/understanding-tax-benefits-on-home-loan-updated\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/tax-benefits-on-education-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">education loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in India, you will get tax benefits on loan repayment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To summarise, the loan interest rates abroad may be quite attractive as compared to rates in India. However, as I have mentioned many times before, understand what you are getting into. You need to look beyond interest rates. Assess the all-in-cost.
