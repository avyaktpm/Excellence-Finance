Even though the loan window is open for only a short period and the loan amount is not likely to be very big, a PPF loan is an option if you are looking for a small loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently, the Government of India came out with new rules for PPF accounts. In fact, the PPF accounts will now be governed under<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/egazette.nic.in\/WriteReadData\/2019\/214661.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Public Provident Fund Scheme, 2019.<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most of the old rules have been retained. There are only a few minor changes with respect to number of deposits allowed per financial year and premature closure rules. We wouldn\u2019t go into those changes. We write about loans on this blog and hence will focus on changes with respect to rules for PPF loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has been a beneficial change in PPF loan rules. Before we discuss that, let\u2019s do a quick recap of PPF loan rules. For a more detailed discussion on PPF loans and various pros and cons, refer to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-ppf-account\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Loan against PPF Account: Recap<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can take a loan against your PPF account from the beginning of third year till the end of 6<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year. The way years are counted is a bit confusing. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The beginning of third year means <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One year from the end of financial year in which you opened the PPF account<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The end of 6<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year means <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 years from the end of financial year in which the PPF account was opened<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, if you opened your PPF on October 14, 2015 (FY2016), you can take loan from April 1, 2017 (FY2018) until the end of March 31, 2021 (FY2021).<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your borrowing depends on the accumulated PPF balance. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can borrow up to 25% of the PPF account balance at the end of previous financial year.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing with the above example,<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From April 1, 2017 until March 31, 2018: You are borrow up to 25% of the PPF account balance as on March 31, 2016.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From April 1, 2018 until March 31, 2019: You are borrow up to 25% of the PPF account balance as on March 31, 2017.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From April 1, 2019 until March 31, 2020: You are borrow up to 25% of the PPF account balance as on March 31, 2018.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From April 1, 2020 until March 31, 2021: You are borrow up to 25% of the PPF account balance as on March 31, 2019.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h2>What Are the Changes That Have Been Brought in for PPF Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, the rate of interest charged for PPF loan was 2% over the PPF interest rate. <\/span><b>Now, this interest rate has been reduced to 1% over the PPF account interest rate.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Therefore, if the PPF interest rate is 8% p.a., then the PPF loan interest rate shall be 9% p.a. (earlier it would have been 10% p.a.). Clearly, this is a beneficial change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that PPF interest rate can change every quarter. Therefore, your loan interest rate will go and up with PPF interest rate. So, if the PPF interest rate goes to 8.2% next quarter, you will have to pay 9.2% on the loan in that quarter.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You must note PPF loan is repaid in a very different manner as compared to a regular loan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is no concept of EMIs. First, you repay the loan in up to 36 months. You can pay the principal lumpsum or in instalments. Once the principal is repaid, your interest amount is calculated. You must pay the interest amount in up to 2 monthly installments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the principal is not repaid within 36 months, the interest rate goes to 6% over the PPF interest rate (instead of 1%) and the interest is debited from the PPF account balance at the end of each financial year. Therefore, non-payment of principal amount can get very expensive. <\/span><b>This excess of 6% is charged since the beginning of the loan (and not just after completion of 36 months).<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the principal is fully repaid but the interest is not paid in due time, the interest is debited from your PPF balance.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>There Is a Change in PPF Loan Form Too<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earlier, you could apply for the PPF loan by using Form D. Now, you will have to use Form 2. Here&#8217;s the form from PPF regulations. You can get this form from the bank where you have opened your PPF account.<\/span><\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_5197\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-5197\" style=\"width: 512px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-5197 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/PPF-Loan-Form.png\" alt=\"PPF Loan Form\" width=\"512\" height=\"549\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/PPF-Loan-Form.png 512w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/PPF-Loan-Form-280x300.png 280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-5197\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">PPF Loan Form<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The latest regulations do not provide a form for loan principal repayment and interest payment.
