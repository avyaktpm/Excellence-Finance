In this post, I will discuss NPS basics, tax benefits on investment and tax treatment at maturity. Finally, I will discuss whether you should invest in NPS.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>NPS Is a Defined Contribution Pension Plan<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under a defined contribution plan, you control the contribution to the pension account but you do not control your pension income. Your pension (or annuity income) will depend on the performance of your investment and the prevailing annuity rate at the time of your retirement.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is in sharp contrast to the concept of pension for old Government employees (joining before 2004), where pension was linked to last drawn salary. Such schemes are defined benefit schemes, where the benefit is defined.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Under NPS, you contribute to your NPS account before retirement. Your investment earns market linked returns. When you retire, you can withdraw a portion of accumulated corpus as lump sum while the remaining must be utilised\u00a0to purchase an annuity plan.<\/p>\n<h3>What Is an Annuity Plan?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under an annuity plan, you purchase an income stream for life time (of fixed number of years) from an insurance company by paying it a lump sum. For instance, if you invest Rs 10 lacs an immediate annuity plan and the prevailing annuity rate is 6%, you will get Rs 60,000 per annum for your lifetime from the insurance company.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note NPS does not provide annuity income. Annuity plan has to be purchased from one of the empanelled insurance companies.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you retire, your salary stops. Regular income from annuity plan can replace your salary at least to some extent.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Salient Features<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone between the age of 18 and 60 can open NPS account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You do not have to be a salaried professional to open an NPS account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two broad NPS models, for <\/span><b>Government employees and All Citizens Model<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>There are three assets classes viz. Equity (E), Government Securities (G) and Corporate debt (C)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maximum allocation to Equity (E) is capped at 50% for subscribers under All Citizens Model. For Government subscribers, it is capped at 15%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two investment options. Under <\/span><b>Active Choice mode<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you select the allocation to different asset classes E, C and G. The cap for equity investment still applies.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under <\/span><b>Auto Choice mode (lifecycle fund)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, equity exposure is automatically reduced as you move closer to retirement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can have two types of NPS accounts i.e. Tier I and Tier II NPS accounts. You cannot open Tier II account unless you have opened Tier I account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>All the tax benefits for NPS are limited to your investment in Tier I NPS account.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no tax benefit for investment in Tier II NPS account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tier II NPS account is like an open ended mutual fund. There are no withdrawal restrictions as in case of Tier I account. You can withdraw your investment whenever you want.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must deposit a minimum of Rs 1,000 per financial year in your Tier I NPS account. There is no maximum limit.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How can I open NPS account?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can open the NPS account through your employer (if you employer offers NPS).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, you can open it on your own. \u00a0You can visit the nearest Point of Presence (PoP) of NPS. You can open NPS account at most bank branches.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can also open NPS account online using your<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/financial-planning\/how-to-open-nps-account-online-using-aadhaar-card\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aadhaar card<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> or using a combination of PAN card and bank account details. You must visit<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/enps.nsdl.com\/eNPS\/LandingPage.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eNPS portal<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to open the account online.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you open NPS account, you are allotted a <\/span><b>Permanent Retirement Account Number (PRAN).<\/b> <b>You can have only one PRAN. This implies you cannot open two NPS accounts (Tier I accounts).\u00a0<\/b><b>PRAN is completely portable.<\/b> <b>You can retain the same PRAN while switching jobs or even after quitting your job.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Tax Benefits for Investing in NPS?<\/h3>\n<p><b>Tax benefits are limited to investments in Tier I NPS account.<\/b><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Section<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Tax Benefit<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Note<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80CCD(1)<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to Rs 1.5 lacs<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additional cap of \u00a0(Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>(Own contribution)<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Not an exclusive tax benefit.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shares the limit with Section 80C investments such as PPF, EPF, insurance, principal repayment of a housing loan etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 80CCE caps the total tax benefit under Section 80C, 80CCC and 80CCD(1) at Rs 1.5 lacs per financial year.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80CCD(1B)<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to Rs 50,000<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>(Own Contribution)<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Exclusive tax benefit.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot use this benefit for any other investment.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80CCD(2)<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Capped at 10% of (Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>(Employer Contribution)<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Not available to self-employed.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only applicable for employer contribution to your NPS account.<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><b>Therefore, you can claim up to a maximum of Rs 2 lacs for own investments in NPS Tier I account. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of this amount, Rs 50,000 is an exclusive benefit under Section 80CCD (1B).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Happens When You Retire or Turn 60?<\/h3>\n<p><b>You must use at least 40% of the accumulated corpus to purchase an annuity plan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Remaining 60% can be withdrawn as lump sum.\u00a0<\/span><b>Do note you can even use the entire corpus to purchase an annuity plan. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending upon your choice, ratio of annuity purchase and lump sum withdrawal can be 40:60, 50:50, 80:20 or even 100:0. \u00a0The only restriction is that at least 40% should be used for annuity purchase.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you wish, you can defer the purchase of annuity plan by up to 3 years. For the remaining portion, you can withdraw the amount at one go or stagger withdrawals till the age of 70 in annual instalments.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subscribers under All Citizens model can even continue investing in NPS account till the age of 70, if they so desire. This flexibility is not available to Government Subscribers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is the Tax Treatment at Maturity?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least 40% of the corpus must be utilised to purchase annuity plan. <\/span><b>Annuity income is taxed in the year of receipt at your marginal income tax rate (income tax slab)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><b>40% of the accumulated corpus can be withdrawn tax free (as lump sum).\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about the remaining 20%?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, it is your choice. You can either utilise the amount to purchase an annuity plan (purchase annuity for 60% of the corpus and not 40%). \u00a0Alternatively, you can withdraw the amount in 9 annual instalments till the age of 70. Annuity income, as mentioned before, will be taxed in year of receipt. Lump sum withdrawal (over and above 40%) shall be added to your income and taxed accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>You must decide the break up between annuity purchase and lump sum withdrawal based on your requirement and tax efficiency.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>What If I Want to Exit NPS before Retiring or Turning 60?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can do that but there is a strong deterrent.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case you exit the NPS before superannuation (retirement) or turning 60, you will have to compulsorily use 80% of the accumulated corpus to purchase an annuity plan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Limited Partial Withdrawals Are Permitted<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, partial withdrawals are permitted for treatment of specified critical illnesses, child education or marriage or purchase of first house.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are many restrictions.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First partial withdrawal is permitted only after 10 years. \u00a0Moreover, only three withdrawals are permitted and each withdrawal should have a gap of 5 years. The condition of gap of 5 years is not applicable in case of critical illnesses.\u00a0<\/span><b>And you can withdraw only up to 25% of own contribution.\u00a0<\/b><b>Clearly, NPS scores very low when it comes to liquidity.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Should You Invest in NPS?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the million dollar question. Should you invest in NPS?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every pension plan (and NPS is no different) has an accumulation phase followed by distribution phase. So, by investing in a pension plan, you contribute to the corpus till your retirement. When you retire, you use the accumulated corpus to purchase an annuity plan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could have accumulated this amount in another investment product, say mutual funds and used the amount to purchase an annuity plan at the time of retirement. By doing so, you would have avoided restrictions on investments (maximum 50% in equity), restrictions on withdrawals and mandatory purchase of annuity (annuity rates are low). You would have been free to corpus as you want. Going by this, it makes little sense to invest in NPS.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>However, NPS offers an exclusive tax benefit of Rs 50,000 under Section 80CCD(1B).\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though investment decisions should not be driven by tax considerations alone, taxation is an important part of decision making.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you fall in 30% tax bracket, you can easily save Rs 15,450 (including cess) by investing Rs 50,000 in NPS. \u00a0You are already paying tax at the highest rate (if you don\u2019t invest in NPS). And you know that 40% of the accumulated corpus is exempt from tax at the time of exit from NPS. <\/span><b>Hence, there is clear potential for tax saving.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can save some tax by planning your lump sum withdrawals and annuity purchase accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Here Is My Take on NPS.<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><b><\/b><b>NPS is better suited to investors in the highest income tax bracket. \u00a0<\/b><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even investors in the lower income tax bracket can invest. However, tax saving will be less. Quite possible you have to pay tax at lower rate now but you may have to pay higher tax rate later because the corpus would have grown by the time you retire.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>Do not invest more than Rs 50,000 per financial year in NPS. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is because exclusive tax benefit under Section 80CCD(1B) is capped at Rs 50,000 per annum.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not invest in NPS to fill your Section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lacs. There are much better investment products in Section 80C to meet that limit. I will pick PPF and ELSS over NPS to fill Section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b><\/b><b>Ensure that NPS does not crowd out your other investments.<\/b><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NPS should only be a small part of your investment. Do not make NPS your primary investment for retirement.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not ignore liquidity restriction in NPS especially if you plan to retire early.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you planning to invest in NPS?
