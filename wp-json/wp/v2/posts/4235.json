To be honest, I was shocked. I thought there will just be a product or two. There were more than 10 products on their website.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, the high number is merely a marketing gimmick. However, as a potential borrower, this is the least of your concern. All you need is a loan product that suits your needs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Gold loan products from Muthoot Finance<\/strong><\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 759px;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td

Muthoot Finance has provided for three regions viz, Kerala, Outside Kerala and Delhi. Rates for the various loan schemes may differ slightly across regions. It is also possible that some of the schemes are region-specific. For instance, Muthoot Premier Loan is available only in the Delhi region.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Please understand descriptions of some of these products were not very clear from the website. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, a few pieces of information on Muthoot Finance website was a bit conflicting. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, in case you are looking for a gold loan from Muthoot Finance, you are advised to do greater research before choosing the best loan product from Muthoot.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>Lower the Loan to Value ratio for your gold loan, lower the interest rate you pay.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a lower LTV ratio, the gold loan company has reduced its risk. With a lower LTV, the gold loan company has better protection against volatility in gold prices.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider a scenario where the borrower defaults and the gold prices correct sharply. In such cases, the value of security may not be enough to square off the principal and accrued interest. With a lower LTV, the gold loan company has increased its cushion. Therefore, the loan company also passes on the benefit to the borrower in the form of lower interest rate.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI caps the LTV of gold loans at 75% of the value of the gold offered as collateral.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note: Muthoot has not explicit provided the LTVs for various types of loans. However, given the description of various products and the difference in rates of interest for various products, you can get this idea.<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>If you agree to pay interest on a regular basis, you can reduce the cost of your loan.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of its offerings, Muthoot Finance offered rebate on interest payments if you made regular interest payments.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another point, albeit not as conclusive, is that the gold loans may not really be cheap. Since the loan is secured, I expected that the rate of interest would be low. However, the rate of interest can be as high as 24% p.a. It is quite possible that you can get a <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/9-things-to-consider-before-availing-personal-loan\/\">cheaper personal loan<\/a>. Even <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/getting-personal-loan-p2p-lending-platforms-india\/\">Peer-to-Peer lending<\/a> platform may be an option. It appears that the Muthoot Finance knows that gold loan is the last resort and are charging the interest rate accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>You always have an option to sell your gold rather than taking a gold loan.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be honest, the interest rates for most of these gold loan products are simply astounding. Frankly, <\/span>unless you have an emotional attachment with your gold\/gold jewellery<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you may be better off selling the gold rather than taking loan against it.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 6-12 months, when you have money in your hand, you can buy back the gold.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You shouldn\u2019t forget various other charges such as processing fee etc. applicable on the gold loans. Therefore, before contemplating loans at such high rate of interest, you must consider selling off the gold too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4241\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/gold-jewellery.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"620\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/gold-jewellery.jpg 620w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/gold-jewellery-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Factors to Consider When Selling Gold vs Taking a Gold Loan<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An aspect to note is that you get loan only for the value of gold. Making charges for the jewellery are ignored. When you try to sell the jewellery, something similar happens.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, when you take a loan and pay it back, you get back the jewellery. However, if you had sold the jewellery and try to buy similar piece of jewellery, you will have to pay making charges again.\u00a0<\/span>No such issue with gold coins.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You might need loan for a small amount. However, it is possible that the jewellery item is quite expensive. In such cases too, you might consider taking a loan instead of selling it off.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>And yes, since it is a loan, you need to pay it back. Be sure of your cashflows before going for any kind of loan. If you don\u2019t repay, bank\/NBFC will anyways auction your gold and recover its loan.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this post, I will list down various gold loan products from Muthoot Finance.
