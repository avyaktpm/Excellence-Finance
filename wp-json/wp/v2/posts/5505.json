While there is a race in the pharma industry to create a vaccine or figure out an effective line of treatment, you can only practice hygiene and social distancing and take precautions. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, given the pace of spread, you would not want to take chances and might want to cover yourself against hospitalization costs if you were to contract Covid-19. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What can you do? What are the kind of insurance plans you can buy?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 3 types of coverage that you can buy.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Regular health insurance plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Covers all kinds of hospitalization, including the one related to Covid-19. Since the coverage is comprehensive, such plans can be expensive.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Covid-19 Specific Health Insurance Plan (Indemnity plan)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: This is also a health insurance plan. However, only the treatment cost of Covid-19 related hospitalization is covered. Hospitalization due to any other reason will not be covered. The insurance company indemnifies you for the expenses incurred due to Covid-19 related hospitalization or treatment cost. The insurance company will not pay more than the actual treatment cost. The policy benefit can be on a cashless basis (the insurer pays the hospital directly) or reimbursement basis (you pay the bill first and claim from the insurance company later). <\/span><b>Corona Kavach plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> belongs to this category.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Covid-19 Related Fixed Benefit Plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you are diagnosed with Covid-19, then the insurance company pays you the entire coverage amount.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/critical-illness-insurance-plan-should-you-buy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Critical illness insurance plans<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> work in this manner. The insurance pay-out has no relation to the actual treatment cost. Your actual treatment cost can be much lower or higher than the actual pay-out. <\/span><b>Corona Rakshak Plan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> belongs to this category.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many insurers have come out with Covid-19 specific health insurance plans. Since it is not easy for a layman to decipher the wordings of a health insurance policy, IRDA, the insurance regulator, came out with guidelines for <\/span><b>standard Covid-19 related health insurance products<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0 All general and standalone health insurance companies must launch the standard products. The only difference across insurers shall be the premium amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Difference Between Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak Plan?<\/h2>\n<table style=\"width: 100.292%; height:

After all, Covid-19 may not be only reason why you may have to get hospitalized. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think a regular health plan is too expensive or if you want to take coverage just against Covid-19 related hospitalization, you can consider Corona Rakshak or Corona Kavach policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between Corona Kavach and Corona Rakshak, it is your preference.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not want uncertainty about the portion of hospital bill covered by the insurance company. Corona Rakshak is a better choice than Corona Kavach. However, you must note that Corona Rakshak plan requires minimum hospitalization of 72 hours. Corona Kavach requires minimum hospitalization of only 24 hours. Moreover, Corona Kavach covers home treatment too in specific cases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corona Rakshak plan has maximum coverage of Rs 2.5 lacs. Corona Kavach plan has maximum coverage of Rs 5 lacs. However, as I understand, you can buy more than one Corona Rakshak plan. Hence, this aspect is not a limitation. By the way, there is no such restriction that you cannot buy both the policies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Additional Reading<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irdai.gov.in\/ADMINCMS\/cms\/Circulars_Layout.aspx?page=PageNo4166\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corona Rakshak: Covid-19 Fixed Benefit based Health Plan (IRDA Guidelines)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irdai.gov.in\/ADMINCMS\/cms\/Circulars_Layout.aspx?page=PageNo4165\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Corona Kavach: Covid-19 Standard Indemnity Health Plan (IRDA Guidelines)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.irdai.gov.in\/ADMINCMS\/cms\/whatsNew_Layout.aspx?page=PageNo4185&amp;flag=1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IRDA Press Release: Corona Kavach Policy<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Covid-19 has affected our lives in many unimaginable ways.
