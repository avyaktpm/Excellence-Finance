I have written many times about how banks and housing finance companies are <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/rbi-is-cutting-rates-are-you-getting-the-full-benefit-on-your-loan\/\">reluctant to pass on the lower rates<\/a> or move you to a more transparent interest rate regime (Base Rate to MCLR or MCLR to Repo Rate Linked loans). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if they are willing, they might want to extract a pound of flesh by charging you a hefty switching fee. However, that may not always be the case. You must do a <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/should-you-switch-from-mclr-to-ebr-or-external-benchmark-loan\/\">cost-benefit analysis<\/a> to figure out if switching is a good choice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>However, before the bank&#8217;s discretion comes into picture, you need to take a step. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">First, you must ask your Bank for a lower rate.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lender will not offer you a lower rate on their own.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will share a recent incident. I was working with an investor and he was very inclined to repay his home loan soon. The outstanding loan amount was big (~67 lacs) and he could not have prepaid the entire loan amount at one go. I noticed the loan interest rate was 8.2% p.a. Given the prevailing interest rates and his credit profile, the interest rate looked on the higher side. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I asked him to reach out to the lender and check if he could get a lower interest rate and the associated switching fee. <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">The lender replied within a day that he could reduce the loan interest from 8.2% to 7.1% by paying a switching fee of ~Rs 3,000.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That\u2019s it. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan was with a Housing Finance company. The lender adjusted the loan spread downward after the fee payment. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the savings are massive. And it is a no-brainer. You do not need a spreadsheet software to figure this out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Impact?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of outstanding EMIs went down from 154 to 140 (The EMI remained unchanged at Rs 70,376). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, a payment of Rs 3,000 saves 14 X 70,376 = Rs 9.85 lacs over the remaining loan tenure. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Had the tenure remained constant and the EMI changed, the EMI would have gone down to Rs 66,329. EMI goes down by Rs 4,046. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You recover the switching fee in just one month.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why Didn\u2019t the Lender Approach the Borrower Earlier?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Valid point. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The banks keep calling you and sending you e-mails for all kinds of promotions (credit card, loans etc). Not in this case. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is unlikely that any promotion will save you the quantum of money that this communication about lowering of interest rate would have done. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lender did not reach out to the borrower. It responded with an offer only when the borrower asked. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This issue has also been raised before. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">Why shouldn\u2019t lenders reach out to borrowers suo moto? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, the banks\/NBFC\/HFCs lose out on higher income. Hence, no incentive for them to reach out. The lender made the offer as soon as the borrower reached out. So, they are safe. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no direction from the Reserve Bank in this regard. Therefore, the lenders can afford to wait for your request.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Cost of Delay?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is important. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the onus is on you to reach out, any delay will have cost impact. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this example, I will consider the impact of delay. If you reach out after 12 months, you will pay a higher rate of interest rate for the next 12 months and a lower rate after that. I have assumed that the loan interest rate and the EMI remains constant during this period.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you switch now, the loan outstanding at the end of 12 months will be Rs 64.94 lacs<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you delay by 12 months, the loan outstanding at the end of 12 months will be Rs 65.31 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because you continued to pay a higher interest rate for 12 months, your principal outstanding is higher by Rs 74,381. Despite this switch to a lower rate (after 12 months), you will take 2.27 more EMIs to close the loan. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cost goes up as you delay the switch.<\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"width: 95.3474%;
