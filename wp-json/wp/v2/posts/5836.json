Usually, we pay house rent through cheques or direct bank transfers. No credit involved. The credit card feature is interesting. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From Paytm\u2019s perspective, this feature makes good sense. House rent payment is one of the biggest monthly recurring payments. Therefore, it makes sense for Paytm to get customers to make rent payments from its app. Moreover, if the customers like this feature, it is easier to downsell other services that Paytm offers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, rent payment through credit card is not a novel feature. Websites\/apps such as Red Giraffe, No Broker and CRED already offer such a facility. We have also written a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-to-pay-house-rent-using-a-credit-card\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post covering rent payment facilities<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> from these websites. However, none of these websites\/apps is even remotely as popular as Paytm.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Pay Rent through Paytm?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you log into the app, go to All Services <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Recharge &amp; Pay Bills <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&gt;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Rent Payment. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to enter the account details of the owner. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thereafter, you can pay the rent through a credit card, debit card, net banking or UPI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Is the Benefit of Making Rent Payment through Paytm?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can make payment through your credit card (among other modes). You get to enjoy an interest-free credit period for up to 45 days. Since the house rent is usually a big amount, you also stand to earn a good number of reward points. You can use these reward points for various freebies.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can expect Paytm to do a good job of putting in a reminder for rental payments too. Once you have set everything up, you can expect everything to be a breeze.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Disadvantages of Paying Rent through Paytm?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no free lunch here. <\/span><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">Paytm will charge a convenience fee of 2 percent on credit card, debit card and net banking payments.<\/span><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"> GST shall be applicable on such convenience fee, taking the total cost to 2.36% of the rent.<\/span><\/strong>\u00a0 Paytm does not keep the entire amount to itself. The fee shall be shared with your card issuing bank, network provider (Visa\/Mastercard) and Paytm.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There will be no charge on UPI and Rupay debit card payments. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note, currently, when you transfer rent to the owner using your mobile banking app or net banking portal, you do not pay anything extra. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s see the difference between various instruments for rent payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Debit Card and Net Banking<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use Paytm for rent payment and pay through debit card or net banking, you do not get any credit facility. The money is debited directly from your savings bank account. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why would you want to pay an extra 2.36% by going the Paytm route?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can simply use your mobile banking app to pay rent. Will be as convenient as Paytm. You wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything extra either.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>UPI or Rupay Debit Card<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paytm does not charge anything for making rent payment through UPI or Rupay Debit card. So, there is no additional cost for you. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In both the cases, your bank account gets debited. You do not get credit. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you can be indifferent between your mobile banking app (or any UPI app) and Paytm. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In either case, you do not pay anything extra.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Credit Card<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You cannot use your mobile banking app to transfer rent to the owner using your credit card. Not allowed. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But you can pay rent from your credit card on Paytm. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get credit. Interest-free credit period. Reward points. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But this credit comes at a cost of 2.36% of the rent amount. Note that this is not interest. This 2.36% is purely the transaction charge. Unavoidable for rent payments through credit card. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>If your monthly rent is Rs 30,000 per month, you will pay Rs 708 extra.<\/strong> <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable paying 2.36% for interest-free credit period and reward points. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there can be an instance when you are pressed for short-term cash. During such times (and I hope such instances are not frequent), you might want to use your credit card to pay house rent. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since a credit card comes into play for rent payment only in times of stress, remember you will have to square off the bill in the next few weeks. If you can\u2019t, you will have to pay 3-3.5% per month on the outstanding amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Should You Do?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paytm offers convenience but not much greater from what your mobile banking app can offer, at least with respect to rent payments. If this convenience comes for free (UPI\/Rupay debit cards), I do not mind using it. However, if there is a cost attached (debit card\/ credit card\/net banking), I wouldn\u2019t be keen to use Paytm for rent payments. Credit cards should be used for rent payments only in extreme scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Paytm has launched a feature where you can pay your house rent using your credit card.
