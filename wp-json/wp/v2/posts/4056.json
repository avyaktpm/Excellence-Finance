The loan will offered by Indiabulls Housing Finance and the special interest rate of 3.99% p.a. applies for purchases in select projects from Tata Housing.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/economictimes.indiatimes.com\/wealth\/personal-finance-news\/tata-housing-offers-home-loan-rate-of-3-99-pc-to-new-buyers\/articleshow\/61596855.cms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Economic Times article<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the low interest rate scheme is valid until December 12, 2017 for 11 projects across 7 cities in India.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At a time where home loans are being sanctioned at interest rate greater than 8% p.a., the deal sounds really attractive. After all, you get 3.5%-4% p.a. on your savings bank account.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, there is not much information about the loan product as yet. Therefore, it is difficult to model the cash flows on a spreadsheet and work out the exact cost of loan during the entire tenure.\u00a0<\/span>However, there are still a few things that you should keep in mind whenever you come across such loan deals.<\/p>\n<h3>This May Be Way for the Builders to Make You Agree to Their Price<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We all know real estate sector is in doldrums. Yes, it is not just the buyers who are struggling. The real estate companies are struggling too. Even though as an end user, we might feel that it is difficult to deal with realty developers, their lenders show them their true place when they go and ask for money.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is another matter when promoters have siphoned off the money from the projects and left the buyers in the lurch.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, I am not saying Tata Housing falls in the same category.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now back to the topic.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With unsold inventory of many quarters a known fact, prospective buyers can get quite aggressive in their negotiations. <\/span><b>In my opinion, this could be a ploy to soften you up during negotiations. This may be a method employed by Tata Housing to purchase at a price they want to sell.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Essentially, since the home loan deal is so attractive, you may feel a bit hesitant to negotiate on the property prices.\u00a0<\/span>By the way, this is a very common persuasion\/negotiation skill. And nothing wrong with that. \u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many times have you offered your kids a chocolate (or something) to get them to do something they wouldn\u2019t normally do?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I have discussed in an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/6-things-keep-mind-taking-home-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it is better to keep price and interest rate negotiations separate.\u00a0<\/span><b>Negotiate the property prices first and then get down to negotiating the loan interest rate.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>The Teaser Loan Is Only for a Few Years<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The special interest rate of 3.99% p.a. is only for the first five years of the home loan. You can expect the interest rate to jump up sharply after the first 5 years. It is quite possible that you have to pay a rate of interest (that is much higher than the regular rate of interest at the time) after 5 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is also possible that the low interest rate is bound by other sub-conditions too. For instance, it could for 5 years or the date of possession, whichever is earlier. In that case, you may have to pay a higher EMI much earlier than expected.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And yes, you must ensure that you can pay a higher EMI too. \u00a0After all, the lower EMI rate is only for the first 5 years. After that, you will have to pay a much higher EMI.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure that you can afford that before you sign up.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Are There Any Restrictions on Pre-Payment?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to see if there are any additional restrictions of loan prepayment during the first 5 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From the perspective of the housing finance company, they get 3.99% p.a. for the next five years. The lender would want you to have sizeable outstanding loan amount once the higher rate kicks in.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is quite possible that there are additional restrictions of loan prepayment. It is possible that the pre-payments may be prohibited during the first 5 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Focus on the Other Charges Too<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many of us focus only on the interest rates while comparing home loan products. You need to consider various ancillary charges too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if the housing finance company or the bank is charging you a very high processing fee for the loan? Since the processing fee is upfront, it can affect the cost of loan sharply.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The effective cost of Rs 20 lacs loan (8% p.a., 20 years) at a processing fee of 1% (plus GST) is 8.14% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">while the cost of Rs 20 lacs loan (8% p.a., 20 years) at a processing fee of 2% (plus GST) is 8.27% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Is Indiabulls Housing Finance Getting Compensated?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This may not be easy to find out.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, Indiabulls Housing Finance needs to be compensated for giving a loan at such a low rate. In absence of other charges\/income, it does not cover the cost of capital.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that the housing finance company charges a very high rate of interest after 5 years. Another interesting aspect to know will be if Indiabulls Housing Finance is being compensated by Tata Housing in any manner (not sure if this is allowed). However, it does not affect you as a borrower. So long as you can figure out the true cost for your loan, you should be able to make \u00a0an informed decision.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the exact details are not available, it is difficult for me to comment about specific of the scheme. My inputs are not specific to this Tata Housing-Indiabulls Housing Finance tie-up. The inputs are valid for any similar scheme you encounter.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a prospective buyer and borrower, you must consider these aspects before you sign up for the offer. Go through the terms and conditions of the scheme before you make your mind.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I have mentioned many times before, in such cases, <\/span><b>spreadsheet is your friend<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I believe the biggest hit to you will be when you do not negotiate on the price of the property. So, negotiate hard. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I recently came across a news item that Tata Housing, a prominent realty company, has tied up with Indiabulls Home Finance to offer home loans at 3.99% p.a.
