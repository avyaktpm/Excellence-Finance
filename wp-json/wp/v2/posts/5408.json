The external benchmark linked loan can have a maximum interest reset period of 3 months. Therefore, you will not have to wait for too long.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your home loan is linked to base rate or MCLR, then your experience can be quite different. We know that the banks are not very keen to pass on the rate cuts to the borrowers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bank releases MCLR for various tenures. The banks typically use 6-month or 1-year MCLR for home loans. Here is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/web\/interest-rates\/interest-rates\/mclr-historical-data\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the link to historical MCLR<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> data for the State Bank of India. SBI uses 1-year MCLR for home loans.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0In September 2019, SBI 1-year MCLR was 8.15% p.a. Now, it is 7.25% p.a. A cut of 90 bps. In the same duration, the Repo rate is down by 140 bps (5.4% to 4%). You might argue that the SBI is yet to account for the latest repo rate cut on May 22<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nd<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Fair enough. We shall see how much SBI MCLR goes down over the next one month. However, the total reduction in MCLR will still be less than the Repo rate.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not an external benchmark, the odds are against you. It is unlikely that the banks will pass the rate cuts at the same rate at which the Reserve Bank is cutting rates.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are still on MCLR or base rate linked loan, approach your bank and try to understand the switching process. It is possible that the bank may charge you the fee for the switch. If the fee is reasonable, switch to the external benchmark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that the bank may tinker around with the spread to keep the interest rate constant (I am not sure of this, but this is possible). In this case, if you think you are getting a raw deal, you can approach another bank to refinance the loan. One way to assess if you are getting a bad deal is to compare your loan interest rate with a new borrower with a similar credit profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have discussed the decision process in detail in<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/should-you-switch-from-mclr-to-ebr-or-external-benchmark-loan\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you getting the full benefits of rate cut?
