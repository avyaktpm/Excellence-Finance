These e-tailers run such promotions regularly to attract buyers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In case of an instant discount<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, if you use a specific credit card or debit card for payment, you get an upfront discount. Suppose an item sells for Rs 50,000. If you use a credit card\/debit card from a particular bank, you may have to pay only Rs 45,000 (10% instant discount).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In case of No-cost EMI<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you do not get any upfront discount. You must still pay Rs 50,000. However, you must pay the amount in 3,6 or 9 months. Let\u2019s say you opt to pay in 9 months. In such a case, you will have to pay Rs 5,555.55 per month for 9 months. From your perspective, it is a loan at 0% interest rate. For more on how No-cost EMI work, refer to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-banks-manage-to-provide-no-cost-emi-on-e-commerce-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-cost EMI technically involves an upfront discount followed by an interest-bearing loan. That\u2019s why it is called a No-cost EMI and not a zero interest EMI. Moreover, you pay slightly more because of the GST on interest component.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if you had to choose between the two? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say Amazon\/Flipkart offers an instant discount on credit card X and offers No-cost EMI on credit card Y. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We assume you can\u2019t get both the offers (Instant discount and the No-cost EMI) on the same purchase. Usually, that\u2019s the case too. <\/span>Which one would you choose?<\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Approach the Problem?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first is about the cash flows. If you think you will find it difficult to pay Rs 45,000 (50,000- 10% instant discount) by the next due date (30-45 days), then instant discount may not really be an option. <\/span>You must go for the No-cost EMI or even a regular EMI. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are indifferent about paying now or over the next few months (you have no capital issues, but you just want to optimize), you may have to do a bit of math. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your options are:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay Rs 45,000 now.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay Rs 5,555.55 over the next 9 months<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Approach 1: Investment Returns You Need to Generate<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By not paying Rs 45,000 now, you are taking up the liability of Rs 5,555.55 over the next 9 months. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you were to invest Rs 45,000 on the date of purchase, what is the investment return you will have to generate to match monthly outgo of 5,555.55 over the next 9 months? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the timing of monthly payment (can range from 21 to 52 days) may vary depending on the credit card due date, I assume that you must make the payment from the next month. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to generate about 2.16% per month (over 26% p.a.) to be able to meet the monthly payments. Quite difficult. Instant discount is the winner.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if the instant discount was only 5% (i.e., you need to pay Rs 47,500 after instant discount)? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to generate about 1.04% per month or 12.46% per annum. Much lower but still quite high. Instant discount is still the winner in my opinion.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What if you opt for a 6-month No-EMI tenure?<\/b><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to generate 1.49% per month or 17.8% per annum in case of a 5% instant discount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to generate 3.1% per month or 37% per annum in case of a 10% instant discount.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, the shorter the No-cost EMI loan tenure, the case for going for instant discount becomes stronger.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">Instant discount will likely win.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Note:<\/strong> GST is charged on the interest portion of the No-cost EMI. I have ignored the impact of such GST payments in these calculations. Including the impact will favour instant discount option.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<h3>Approach 2: Calculate Notional Discount in No-Cost EMI<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is another way to look at this, albeit not very practical. This may not be the right approach either, but it is good to know, nonetheless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know from the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-banks-manage-to-provide-no-cost-emi-on-e-commerce-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">detailed post on No-cost EMIs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that such offers include an upfront discount followed by an interest-bearing loan. For instance, let\u2019s say the bank loan interest rate is 13% p.a. For a No-cost EMI, you will get an upfront discount so that the resulting loan leads to an EMI (equal to no cost EMI) at 13% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase amount: Rs 50,000<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-cost EMI tenure: 9 months<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rate: 13% p.a.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-cost EMI: 50,000\/9 = Rs 5,555.55<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Amount: You can use PV function (or our <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-calculator\/\">loan amount calculator<\/a>) to figure what loan amount would lead to an EMI of 5,555.55 for 9 months at 13% p.a. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That amount is Rs 47,395<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Upfront discount = Rs 50,000 \u2013 Rs 47,395 = Rs 2,605<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let\u2019s further assume that after opting for instant discount, you had to opt for a regular EMI at 13% (same as implicit interest rate for No-cost EMI).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get a discount of Rs 5,000 (higher than Rs 2,605) with an instant discount of 10%. This will result in an EMI of Rs. 5,274 (45,000, 13% p.a., 9 months). Lower than Rs. 5,555.55.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get a discount of Rs 2,500 (lower than Rs 2,605) with an instant discount of 5%. This will result in an EMI of Rs. 5,567 (47,500, 13% p.a., 9 months).\u00a0 Just higher than Rs. 5,555.55.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the outcome (for either of the approaches) may be different depending on the quantum of instant discount (5%, 10% etc.) and tenure of no-cost EMI.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\">The higher instant discount and shorter no-cost EMI tenure will tilt the scale in favour of Instant discount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\">The lower instant discount and longer No-cost EMI tenure will tilt the scale favour of No-cost EMI.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400; background-color: #ffffaa;\">Given the quantum of instant discounts we usually see and given that the tenure of no-cost EMI can\u2019t be too long, instant discount will be the likely winner.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you shop regularly from Flipkart or Amazon website\/apps, you must already be aware of the instant discount and No-cost EMI offers.
