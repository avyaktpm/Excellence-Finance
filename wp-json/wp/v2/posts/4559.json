You can pledge your gold jewellery with a bank or a gold loan company to get a short-term loan. When you repay the loan, you get your jewellery back.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the gold loan is secured (backed by your jewellery), you can expect the interest rates to be low. However, to be honest, this may not always be the case. I have seen interest rate of a gold loan (especially from gold finance companies) to be much higher than rate for a personal loan. This is a digression from the main topic though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have reviewed gold loan products from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/axis-bank-gold-loan-review\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/muthoot-finance-gold-loan-products\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Muthoot Finance<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in my earlier posts.

Gold coins purchased from jewellers are not eligible as collateral for the gold loan. Moreover, you can get gold loan for only up to 50 grams of gold coins. Do note these restrictions are not bank specific and have been placed by the Reserve Bank of India. Refer to<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/BS_ViewMasCirculardetails.aspx?id=9902#2310\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI Master Circular on Loans and Advances<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more on this.

Therefore, the loan interest rate will be 10.5% p.a. Do note that<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/marginal-cost-of-funds-based-lending-rate-mclr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MCLR gets revised every month<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. However, once you take the loan, your loan interest rate will stay constant for 1 year and will reset at the prevailing rate every 12 months.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rate of interest looks quite attractive as compared to gold loans from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/axis-bank-gold-loan-review\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">some of the banks<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/muthoot-finance-gold-loan-products\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">NBFCs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that we have reviewed earlier.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing fee at 0.5% shall be charged subject to a minimum of Rs 500. GST shall be extra.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any charges for the appraisal of gold shall be borne by the applicant.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Points to Note<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBI website does not make any mention of the purity of gold required. \u00a0As per RBI guidelines, gold ornaments and jewellery are valued at average of closing price for the past 30 days as quoted by Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJA). If the jewellery is than 22 carats gold, such jewellery shall be valued proportionately.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get loan only for the value of the gold in the jewellery. The studded stones and intricate work in the jewellery do not add to the loan potential of the jewellery.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan facility may be available at only select branches of SBI. Personally, I expect the disbursement process to be more cumbersome and slower than pure gold loan companies such as Muthoot and Manappuram Finance.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you cannot repay the loan, the bank can sell your jewellery to recover the loan. Any excess amount left after settlement of loan will be returned to you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/cibil-score-understand-how-it-affects-your-loan-application\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CIBIL score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is not a big concern in case of gold loans. You can get a gold loan even if your CIBIL score is not very good. However, if your CIBIL score is good, you can even apply for a personal loan. With a good CIBIL score and repayment ability, you may get the loan at a similar rate, with less documentation and for a longer tenure too.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3><b>Additional Reading<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more information, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/personal-banking\/gold-loans\">visit the SBI Gold Loans page<\/a><\/span>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A gold loan is a quick way to raise funds for short to medium term needs.
