However, for the fee\/charge linked to the size of the loan, the impact can be significant.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at how these charges can affect your overall cost of loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The Impact of Charges Is Higher in a Short Term Loan<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a short-term loan, the charges have to be spread over a shorter loan term.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s try to understand with the help of an example.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A loan of Rs 10 lacs at 10% p.a. for a tenure of 3 years. The EMI for this loan is Rs 32,267.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A loan of Rs 10 lacs at 10% p.a. for a tenure of 20 years. The EMI for this loan is Rs. 9,650.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing fee is 1% of the loan amount plus taxes in both the cases. Therefore, the fee will be Rs 10,000 + 18% GST = Rs 11,800. If you see, due to GST, the effective processing fee is 1.18% (and not 1%). Since GST is applicable on all kinds of fees, expect the impact to be a bit higher.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have adjusted the loan amount by the upfront fee payable. Therefore, if the loan amount is Rs 10 lacs and the processing fee is Rs 11,800, your net loan amount becomes Rs 988,200. Of course, your loan EMI remains the same.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accounting for the processing fee, the net cost of a 3 year loan goes up to 10.82% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, the net cost of a 20 year loan goes up to 10.17% p.a.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact for the shorter term loan is higher because the cost has to be spread over the shorter term.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I did the analysis for different levels of processing fees.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Amount<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rs 10 lacs<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest Rate<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\" colspan=\"2\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10%<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20 years<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing Fee<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Cost<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Net Cost<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.82%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.17%<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">11.65%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.35%<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">12.50%<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10.53%<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>You can see how the impact rises with the increase in processing fee.\u00a0You may ignore this impact but your banker is always aware of the maths.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the following two scenarios for 3 year loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan at 10% with processing fee of 2%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan at 11% with waiver on processing fee<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you focus only on the interest rates, you will go with the first option, where the effective cost of loan id 11.65% p.a. Second option would have been a better choice even though it comes at a higher rate of interest.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And banks can always play this trick on you.\u00a0<\/span>Reduce the interest rate but recover by hiking other charges.\u00a0If you are not aware of the math, you are likely to fall for the trap.<\/p>\n<h2>A Few Contingent Charges May Affect Your Flexibility<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few charges may be contingent; i.e., you will have to incur those charges only on occurrence of an event. One such charge is pre-payment penalty.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-payment penalty is waived for floating rate loans. However, in case of a fixed rate loan, pre-payment penalty can be extremely high.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have taken a personal loan or a car loan at a fixed rate, prepayment will have a cost involved and will add to your overall cost of loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal loans and car loans are expensive loans. Loan amount is not very big. There are no tax benefit on repayment. Therefore, there is every incentive for you to try to close these loans. However, a pre-payment penalty can be a deterrent. From the perspective of the bank, that\u2019s exactly the reason why such a clause exists.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s consider an example.\u00a0<\/span>Loan amount: Rs 10 lacs, Interest rate: 10%, Tenure: 3 years.\u00a0Pre-payment penalty: 5% of the prepayment amount (plus 18% GST).\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s assume there is no processing fee or other charges.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s further assume that you try to prepay the loan after 2 years. At the end of 2 years, the outstanding loan amount will be Rs 3.67 lacs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-payment penalty (including taxes) will be Rs 21,654. For a borrower, this hit is unfair.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you pre-close the loan after 2 years, the cost of the loan will come out to 11.35% p.a. (up from 10% p.a.).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, the impact of contingent charges is difficult to assess accurately upfront. This is because you do not know upfront when you will prepay the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given a choice, go with the option that has the lowest overall cost (and not just the lowest interest rates). When it comes to contingent charges such as prepayment penalty, assess the applicability in your case. If there is a strong possibility of contingent event happening (say, you prepaying a loan), do weigh in those charges too.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many banks waive processing fees for small periods. Of course, you can\u2019t wait for the bank to waive off the processing fee before you apply for the loan. However, there is nothing wrong in keeping your eyes and ears open.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there is no excuse for not understanding all the loan charges before signing the dotted line. You can ask the banker for the list of all the charges. Go through the sample loan agreement to understand the contingent charges, if any.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When we are scouting for a loan, many of us focus merely on the interest rates.
