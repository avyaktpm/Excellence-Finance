In most cases, the extra money just sits in their savings accounts earning below par (and taxable) interest. A home saver loan lets you have the cake and eat it too. You will be able to park this amount in the home loan account for any number of days and pull it out anytime for your urgent needs or regular expenses when they become due (e.g., paying kids school fees every quarter). The money thus kept in the home loan account reduces the total interest outgo on your home loan and helps you close your loan faster.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">MaxGain is a popular home saver loan product from SBI. Similar home saver loans, albeit with different interest rates, are also available from other banks including Citibank (<a title=\"Citibank Home Credit\" href=\"http:\/\/www.online.citibank.co.in\/products-services\/loans\/home-credit.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Credit<\/a>), Standard Chartered Bank (<a title=\"Standard Chartered Bank HomeSaver\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sc.com\/in\/borrow\/loans-homesaver.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HomeSaver<\/a>), HSBC (<a title=\"HSBC Smart Home\" href=\"http:\/\/www.hsbc.co.in\/1\/2\/personal\/loans\/smart-home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smart Home<\/a>) and IDBI Bank (<a title=\"IDBI Bank Home Loan Interest Saver\" href=\"http:\/\/www.idbi.com\/home-loan-interest-saver.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Home Loan Interest Saver<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will focus exclusively on SBI MaxGain in this article. Other home saver loans listed above are quite similar and may differ in minor details. Before we delve deeper into SBI MaxGain, let\u2019s understand what is an overdraft (OD) account.<\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is overdraft (OD)?<\/h2>\n<p>An <a title=\"How borrowers can use overdraft facility wisely\" href=\"http:\/\/articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\/2013-04-30\/news\/38929896_1_fixed-deposits-overdraft-credit-facility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">overdraft facility<\/a> is a credit line provided to individuals against their assets. You can think of it as being similar to a credit card with a limit but without the interest-free (grace) period. i.e., the interest clock starts ticking as soon as the amount is withdrawn instead of waiting until the payment due date. The interest rate on overdraft account is typically lower than credit card. You can withdraw money upto the sanctioned limit and will have to repay the outstanding balance along with interest only for the duration that you utilize the money from the account.<b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/b><\/p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How is SBI MaxGain different from regular home loans?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a title=\"SBI MaxGain\" href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/user.htm?action=viewsection&amp;lang=0&amp;id=0,1,20,115,741,786\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SBI MaxGain<\/a> is a home loan that is sanctioned as an OD with a limit that is equal to the approved loan amount. Your home acts as the underlying security for the OD account. This product has the same interest rate as the other home loans from SBI upto Rs. 1 crore (as of this writing). A premium of 0.25% is applied for home loans above Rs. 1 crore. There is no extra charge for use of OD facility. The current account (OD) comes with cheque book and net banking facility.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Home saver loans are suited for those individuals:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><del>whose earnings aren\u2019t constant &#8211; self-employed or businessmen.<\/del> At a recent real estate expo, SBI told me that MaxGain isn&#8217;t available for the self-employed and businessmen.<\/li>\n<li>who have a periodic (quarterly, semi-annual or annual) bonus or variable pay component that can be parked in the OD account.<\/li>\n<li>who have savings after paying EMI and other monthly expenses.<\/li>\n<li>NRIs and professionals with higher income.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">How does monthly payment work?<\/h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A typical MaxGain account statement looks like this:<\/p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"195\" \/>\n<col width=\"235\" \/><\/colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Description<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">SBI H L MAXGAIN AUG11<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Name<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">Mr. FIRSTNAME LASTNAME<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Book Balance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">-14,62,750.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Available Balance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">1,00,366.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Limit<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">15,63,116.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Uncleared balance<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">0.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Drawing Power<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">15,63,116.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Currency<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">INR<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Rate of Interest (% p.a.)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">10.3%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><strong>Lien Amount<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">0.00<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<\/div>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are a few points to help understand the how monthly payment works:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Upon final disbursal, your Limit and Drawing Power will equal the sanctioned loan amount. These amounts will reduce with each EMI payment.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Drawing Power<\/strong> = Outstanding principal loan amount.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Available Balance<\/strong> = Any surplus amount parked in this account + accrued interest savings. More on this below (Point 5 thru 8).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Book Balance<\/strong> = Drawing Power &#8211; Available Balance. This is shown as a negative (minus) amount.<\/li>\n<li>Your monthly EMI will not vary despite surplus amount in the OD account.<\/li>\n<li>Principal portion of the EMI is applied on the date of EMI payment and goes to reduce the Drawing Power and the Limit. The principal portion of the EMI is calculated as per the original amortization schedule. Surplus amount deposited in the OD account and accrued interest savings do not alter the principal portion of the EMI.<\/li>\n<li>Interest portion is calculated against the Book Balance on a daily basis and is debited at the end of the month.<\/li>\n<li>All surplus money parked in the home loan account goes towards Available Balance. Even if the surplus amount is kept only for a few days during the month, it helps reduce the interest component of the EMI for that month. Since the interest is calculated on the Book Balance instead of outstanding principal, any excess amount (i.e., EMI &#8211; Principal &#8211; Interest) is added to the Available Balance.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here\u2019s a comparison of amortization schedule (first 24 months only) of regular home loan and SBI MaxGain:<\/p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_2585\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2585\" style=\"width: 553px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/SBI-MaxGain1.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-2585 \" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/SBI-MaxGain1-1024x568.png\" alt=\"Comparison of amortization schedule of regular home loan vs SBI MaxGain\" width=\"553\" height=\"307\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/SBI-MaxGain1-1024x568.png 1024w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/SBI-MaxGain1.png 1276w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-2585\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Amortization schedule (first 24 months only) of regular home loan vs SBI MaxGain<br \/>(Click to enlarge)<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We will assume that both home loans have the same principal amount, interest rate and tenure. As you can see from the schedule, the borrower does the following deposits into (and withdrawals from) his SBI MaxGain account during the first 24 months:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Deposits a surplus amount of 2,00,000 at the beginning of month-6<\/li>\n<li>Withdraws 1,00,000 in month-12 for his kid&#8217;s school fees<\/li>\n<li>Withdraws 1,00,000 in month-17 for family vacation<\/li>\n<li>Gets a salary hike and starts depositing 20,000 each month from month-18<\/li>\n<li>Withdraws 1,20,000 in month-24 to pay his kid\u2019s school fees<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Although the borrower has withdrawn all the surplus money that he deposited at the end of month-24, he still has interest savings (Available Balance) of 19,529.72. You cannot achieve such results using the regular home loan.<b><b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/b><\/p>\n<p class=\"infobox\"><strong><a title=\"SBI MaxGain Excel\" href=\"https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1YCv6Sj9Iyc7Or9iCOv8Coiz3VqDsHg0qNvyLBe_k0P0\/copy?usp=sharing\">SBI MaxGain Excel &#8211; Daily Interest Calculation<\/a> <\/strong><\/p>\n<div dir=\"ltr\">\n<table>\n<colgroup>\n<col width=\"36\" \/>\n<col width=\"283\" \/>\n<col width=\"305\" \/><\/colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\"><\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Regular Home Loan<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>SBI MaxGain Home Loan<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>1<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #dddddd;\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">EMI includes two components: Principal and Interest.
