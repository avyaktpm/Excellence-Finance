And A new year brings new resolutions. Let us look at some of the credit resolutions for 2021 you can consider.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2># 1 Reduce Debt<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This applies to those who are currently struggling with credit burden.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only two ways to reduce credit burden.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce the quantum of debt (Possible through repayments or prepayments)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reduce the cost of debt (balance transfer, taking a low-cost loan to square off a more expensive loan).<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use a mix of the two approaches too. There is no other way to reduce credit burden. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are juggling between multiple debt, you can use one of the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/overcoming-debt-debt-snowball-vs-debt-avalanche\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">debt management techniques<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to reduce debt.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Borrow Responsibly<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This applies to everyone. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do not borrow more than you can comfortably repay. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cComfortable\u201d is slightly subjective. You may easily be able to repay EMIs today but not in case of a salary cut or a job loss. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grant yourself some cushion. Do not borrow the maximum you can. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And things will go wrong. Keep an adequate emergency buffer to tide over short term cashflow gaps. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, it is not just about \u201cHow much you borrow?\u201d. It is also about \u201cWhat you borrow for?\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everyone thinks alike. Some of us might attach greater value to physical possessions while the others might value experiences more. Hence, it is improper for me to comment on what constitutes a creditworthy spend. You are the best judge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not too much in favour of taking credit for lifestyle related expenses (expensive gadgets, vacations etc). I would rather pay directly from my bank account. Or I spend on my credit card and then pay in full in the next billing cycle. But that\u2019s my opinion. You might think differently.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Do not go overboard. Be responsible. Exercise discretion. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With easy access to credit, there might be a tendency to overspend. Resist those urges.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Pay Credit Card Bills in Full<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A credit card is the most convenient and the quickest way to access credit. It is revolving credit. i.e., the credit limit replenishes once you pay off the debt. If you pay in full before the due date, you do not have to pay any interest either. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With other types of loans, you must apply. It takes some time before the fund reaches you. It is a one-time disbursal. You will have to pay interest too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, credit card debt is the most expensive debt. If you do not pay in full, you will pay 36-45% p.a. in interest costs. And that is before penalties and service charges. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if you know before swiping your card that you may not be able to settle the bill in full in the next cycle, think twice before swiping your credit card. At least, do not use the credit card for expenses that are not really urgent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, most banks give you an option to convert credit card outstanding into relatively low-cost personal loans, but I would avoid such options for non-urgent expenses (again, that\u2019s me).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Not All Debt Is Bad<\/h2>\n<p><b>Do not go to the other extreme either.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are people who simply hate taking a loan or using a credit card. It is a good thing to do if you have the money in your bank account. However, not all of us have that luxury.<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/are-all-emis-bad\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saving up<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may not always be an option for everyone. You may have to borrow to buy an asset or fund an expense.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Not all debt is bad<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you have taken a loan to buy an appreciating tangible asset (home loan) or an intangible asset (education loan), it is usually a fine choice, unless the cost or the debt is not excessive. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 1rem;\">The answer gets more subjective when you borrow for funding an avoidable or non-urgent expense. Use your judgement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, using your credit card can help you save money too. Remember <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/instant-discount-or-no-cost-emi-which-is-better\/\">instant discounts or No-cost EMIs<\/a>. Instant discounts result in instant savings, while No-cost EMIs spread out the expense over a few months potentially increasing your affordability. I see nothing wrong in availing these options, provided you can pay on time and you do not end up buying things you can easily do without.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">Never forget that these offers are nudges for you to spend. Be responsible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#5 Check Your Credit Score Regularly<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have discussed earlier that your credit score not only affects your chances of getting credit but also the cost of credit. Hence, it is important that you keep an eye on your credit score, especially if you plan to take a loan in the future.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And now, you do not even have to pay anything to access your credit report. RBI has<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/BS_CircularIndexDisplay.aspx?Id=10590\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">directed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> all Credit Information Companies (CICs) such as<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/check-your-free-credit-report-before-applying-for-a-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CIBIL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to provide one free credit report each calendar year (January 1- December 31) to users.\u00a0 I think that is a good enough frequency. You do not need to check your credit report daily.\u00a0 Note that you can access 1 free credit report from each CIC per calendar year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are discrepancies (incorrect reporting) in your credit report, take it up with the concerned bank and get it rectified. If your credit score is low for valid reasons, you must start working towards<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/7-ways-improve-credit-score\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">improving the score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#6 Be Aware. Get Your Math Right<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are paying 8% p.a. on your home loan. Simply by requesting your bank, you can get the loan interest rate down to 7% p.a. This helps you save 20 EMIs. All you had to do was to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/ask-your-bank-for-a-lower-interest-rate-today\/\">ask the bank to change your loan benchmark<\/a>. And you would ask only if you are aware.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You focused on the low interest rate but forgot about the heavy processing fee for a 6-month loan. If you had done the math, you would have gone with a slightly higher interest rate but low processing fee option. While evaluating loan options, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/when-you-are-hunting-for-a-loan-look-beyond-interest-rates\/\">consider the all-in cost and not just the interest rate cost<\/a>. This requires you to spend some time but helps you save a lot of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Which credit resolution do you plan to add to your resolution list for 2021? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us know in the comments section.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is a new year.
