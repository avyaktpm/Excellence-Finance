I noticed there were a few bikes for adults whose cost were as high as Rs. 1.8 lacs. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know that bicycles could be that expensive. I believe those were models for racers, endurance cyclers or those with real passion for biking.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this website, we write about loans.

The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.autopunditz.com\/news\/indian-2-wheeler-sales-figures-november-2018\/\">sales numbers of these Super bikes<\/a> range from a few hundreds to low thousands per year.

Very minimal details are present on the websites (quite unlike other loan products). However, there is little doubt that the loan criteria will be stringent compared to regular 2-wheeler loan products.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, minimum annual income criteria for SBI super bike loan is only Rs 2.5 lacs. However, for someone with such income, it is almost impossible to get a loan of Rs 5 lacs for 3 years. The EMI will be Rs 16,559 at 11.8% p.a.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember, the banks want to ensure loan repayment from retail borrowers. Therefore, your repayment ability will be verified.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some banks may link the loan amount to ex-showroom price while the others link it to on-road price. This may also be a decision factor.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong>Interestingly, for some of these super bike loans, the interest rate is lower than the regular two-wheeler. I believe the super bike loans will be extended to borrowers with good credit history and high income.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few banks may also push insurance products along with the loan product.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The range of interest rates is quite large. If you find the rate too high, do consider a personal loan as an alternative.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Additional Reading<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/personal-banking\/super-bike-loan-scheme\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI Super Bike Loan page on SBI website<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/two-wheeler-loan\/new-two-wheeler-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank Super Bike Loan page on Axis Bank Website<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hdfcbank.com\/personal\/products\/loans\/two-wheeler-loans\/super-bike-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HDFC Super Bike Loan on HDFC website<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Recently, I checked into a bicycle store to purchase a bicycle for my daughter.
