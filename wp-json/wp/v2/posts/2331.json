The schemes vary the loan repayment methods, interest rates, interest rate types (ex: floating, fixed, dual rate) etc. Each scheme comes with its own terms &amp; conditions and appeals to individual needs of different types of customers.<\/p>\n<p>EMI in advance (aka Advance EMI scheme) is a common feature of car loans offered by most banks in India. In this scheme, you agree to make a payment of one EMI in advance to the bank. Generally banks deduct this amount from the loan amount disbursed to the car dealer. This difference amount gets added to the margin money that you owe to the dealer. Note that the entire advance EMI amount goes to reduce the principal loan amount. Subsequent EMI payments are counted towards both the principal and the interest parts of the car loan.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, EMI in arrears (aka Standard EMI OR Arrears EMI scheme) does not require you to make any advance EMI payments to the bank and the entire loan amount, minus the one-time charges &amp; fees, is disbursed.<\/p>\n<p>To illustrate with an example, let\u2019s compare the scenarios of borrowing a car loan in Advance EMI vs. Arrears EMI scheme.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Car<\/strong>: Hyundai i10<br \/>\n<strong>On Road Price<\/strong>: \u20b9 4.5 lakhs<br \/>\n<strong>Car Loan you applied for<\/strong>: \u20b9 3 lakhs<br \/>\n<strong>Loan interest rate<\/strong>: 12%<br \/>\n<strong>Loan Tenure<\/strong>: 36 months<br \/>\n<strong>Processing Fees<\/strong>: \u20b9 3,000<\/p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><\/th>\n<th><strong>EMI<\/strong><\/th>\n<th><strong>Disbursed Loan Amount <\/strong>(Applied Car Loan Amount \u2013 Processing Fees \u2013 Advance EMI)<\/th>\n<th><strong>Down Payment <\/strong>(Car Price &#8211; Disbursed Loan amount)<\/th>\n<th><strong>Total cost of the car <\/strong>(Down Payment + (EMI * No. of remaining EMI payments))<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Advance EMI Scheme (A)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b99,866<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 3,00,000<br \/>\n&#8211; \u20b9 3,000<br \/>\n&#8211; \u20b9 9,866<br \/>\n= \u20b9 2,87,134<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 4,50,000<br \/>\n&#8211; \u20b9 2,87,134<br \/>\n= \u20b9 1,62,866<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 1,62,866<br \/>\n+ (\u20b9 9,866 * 35)<br \/>\n= \u20b9 5,08,176<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Arrears EMI Scheme (B)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b99,964<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 3,00,000<br \/>\n&#8211; \u20b9 3,000<br \/>\n= \u20b9 2,97,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 4,50,000<br \/>\n&#8211; \u20b9 2,97,000<br \/>\n= \u20b9 1,53,000<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 1,53,000<br \/>\n+ (\u20b9 9,964 * 36)<br \/>\n= \u20b9 5,11,704<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Difference (A &#8211; B)<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b998 less<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 9,866 less<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 9,866 more<\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: right;\">\u20b9 3,528 less<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><em>Note: The above calculation rounds off all numbers to their nearest full rupee amount.
