If we leave out informal options like hand loans from friends and family, you must fund the expense through credit. Let\u2019s assume the amount is not big enough for you to go through the pain of applying for a secured loan. Or let\u2019s say you don\u2019t have any assets to offer as security. In that case, you must go with an unsecured loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unsecured loans can take many shapes. You can use your credit card. You can go for a personal loan (there are many types of personal loans). You can go to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/getting-personal-loan-p2p-lending-platforms-india\/\">P2P lending<\/a> sites to get credit. Let\u2019s further assume that you need to make a choice between swiping your credit card or taking a personal loan. Which option would you choose?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, both are loans. The difference lies in the repayment structures of the two methods. Let\u2019s compare the two credit options, 3 factors to consider and see what will make a good choice for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#1 Speed of Disbursal.<\/strong>\u00a0Credit card usage is instant. You can swipe your credit card and you get the credit. In case of personal loans, the application process is more formal and can be time-consuming. It may take a few days for you to get the credit.\u00a0 Even though many banks and financial firms claim to provide instant loans, this may not happen for everyone. There are many factors including your credit scores considered. Hence, there is always an element of uncertainty about the loan sanction and disbursement timelines. Therefore, if you need money urgently, swiping your credit card looks like a better option.<\/p>\n<p><strong>#2 Amount.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quantum of loan is capped at your credit card limit. In case of a personal loan, you may be able to get much higher amount, depending upon your repayment ability. In this post, let\u2019s assume this is not a factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#3 Repayment and Interest Rate.<\/strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/9-things-to-consider-before-availing-personal-loan\/\">personal loans<\/a>, the loan tenure can be up to 5 years. You will have to pay interest from the date of disbursal. The interest rate will depend on your repayment ability and credit score and can range between 10% to 24%.\u00a0 Much lower than credit card. Apart from that, there will be other ancillary charges such as processing fee that will increase the effective cost of your loan. Personal loans also have prepayment penalty. There is no GST on interest payment though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With credit cards, you must make the payment by the next due date. Even in the best-case scenario, you would have to make the payment with next 45-52 days. If you repay by the next month\u2019s statement due date, then you don\u2019t pay any interest on the amount availed. However, if you can\u2019t pay your credit card bill in full by the due date, it can become a huge problem. You will be charged interest rate from the date of purchase. The rates are exorbitant too and can easily be in excess of 40% per annum. There is GST too on credit card interest payments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Making <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/why-paying-credit-card-minimum-payment-due-is-a-bad-idea\/\">minimum payments won\u2019t help<\/a> beyond a point. Minimum payments can avoid hit to your credit score. However, it will not save you anything on the interest costs. In such cases, it may be prudent to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/converting-credit-card-outstanding-into-emis\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">convert credit card outstanding amount to EMIs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. By the way, when you do that, all sets of charges associated with a personal loan come into picture. You will have to pay processing fee and other charges. Worse still, you will still have to pay GST on the interest component on EMIs. Therefore, if you foresee that you will have to convert your outstanding amount to EMIs, it is better to go with a personal loan.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Should You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, you need to see if you must take credit. Loans must be repaid. Therefore, you must exercise discipline while<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/when-is-it-foolish-to-take-a-personal-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">swiping your credit card or applying for a loan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Reckless spending due to easy access to credit can land you in financial problems. Assuming the expense must be incurred, and the choice must be made between a credit card and personal loans, the choice depends on your cashflows, how quickly you need the money and the amount of loan\/credit you need.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think you can repay the credit card outstanding by the new due date, then credit card is a clear winner over a personal loan. You won\u2019t have to pay any interest. You will earn some <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-to-use-credit-card-reward-points-smartly\/\">reward points<\/a> too. A personal loan will be an expensive option in such cases. Not only will you have to incur interest cost and ancillary charges, the prepayment penalty will make it difficult to close the loan even when you have the money. <\/span><b>A <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/five-advantages-of-using-a-credit-card\/\">credit card<\/a> is a better option for small amounts that you can repay in the next few weeks.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>On the other hand, if the amount is big and you can only repay the amount over the next few months or years, a personal loan is a better option<\/strong>. In other words, if your cash flows are stretched and are likely to remain that way, it is better to opt for a personal loan that can provide a comfortable repayment schedule.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You must make a purchase or spend some money, but you don\u2019t have the money.
