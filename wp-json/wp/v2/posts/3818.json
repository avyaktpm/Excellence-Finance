You have never shared payment details with anyone. Despite exercising a lot of care, it may well happen that you may be at receiving end of a credit card fraud.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you do in such a case? More importantly, what is your liability? Do you have to pay for all the fraudulent transactions? Or is there a cap on your liability as a customer?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI has come out with<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/scripts\/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=3235\"> <b>draft circular<\/b><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on August 21, 2016 specifying the extent of customer liability in case of any banking fraud. This includes credit card frauds too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, I will discuss these guidelines and how it limits liability of a customer in case of a fraud.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A fraud can happen due to one of the following three reasons.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your negligence<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Negligence\/fraud on the part of the bank<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Third party breach or fraud (neither you nor the bank is at fault)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your liability depends on the cause\/reason behind the fraud.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Happens in Case of Negligence by the Customer?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You share your card details with someone or you lose your card but do not care to report it to the bank. Or you use your credit card to make a purchase on an obscure non-trustworthy website. In such a case, you must bear the entire loss (and rightfully so) till such time you report the fraudulent transaction to the bank.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the transaction is reported to the bank, the bank will have to bear loss due to any subsequent fraudulent transaction.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may ask who decides if the fraud happened due to your negligence. RBI has put the onus on the bank to prove your negligence. If the bank can\u2019t establish this with a limited time frame (as per bank policy), it needs to foot the bill.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Happens in Case of Negligence\/Fraud by the Bank?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of fraud\/negligence on part of the bank (irrespective of whether the fraudulent transaction is reported by the customer or not), your liability is NIL. The bank has to bear the entire loss.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Happens in Case of Third Party Breach?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depends on how soon you report the transaction to the bank. Your timer starts from the moment you receive communication (SMS\/e-mail\/statement) about the transaction from the bank. When you notify the bank:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within 3 days: Your liability is NIL.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Within 4-7 days: Your liability is capped at Rs 5,000.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 7 days: Amount to determined based upon board approved policy<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, it is your responsibility to identify that the transaction is fraudulent. Why else will you report?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, pay attention to communication about transaction from the bank.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remember there is no liability if you report the fraudulent transaction within 3 days to the bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Who Shares the Burden of Proof?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This aspect is quite important. Before anything, culprit behind this transaction needs to be established. Banks will always try to establish that the fault is at customer\u2019s end because customer\u2019s liability is NIL or quite limited otherwise. Banks have limited recourse in case of own negligence or third party fraud. It is not difficult to see that this can get quite subjective.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good part is that the onus is on the bank to prove that it was customer\u2019s negligence that caused the fraud. The <\/span><b>board approved policy<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> should also specify the maximum time period to establish customer negligence.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the bank fails to do so, it will have to compensate the customer.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, this looks extremely customer friendly. But we all know how banks and insurance companies rely on flimsy rules or evidence for almost everything. A bank can still attribute your fault and you will have to fight it out.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, do not exercise any lesser caution while using your credit card and think these RBI guidelines will save you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Long Does It Take for Reversal of Transaction?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If it is a case where customer liability is zero or limited, the transaction shall be reversed within 10 days of reporting.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks may also choose to waive off customer liability (even in cases of customer negligence). Well, you don\u2019t expect banks to show any compassion, do you?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, bank must ensure that you do not lose out on any interest in case of debit card\/bank account transaction or bear any additional burden of interest in case of credit cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Should You Do When You Encounter a Fraudulent Transaction?<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call up the bank to intimate about the fraudulent transaction and get the card blocked. (RBI circular does not mention anything about blocking the card). You can also report loss or theft of card, if that\u2019s the case. By the way, you have to mandatorily register for alerts for electronic transactions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Drop an e-mail to the bank to keep record of the communication. You know banks can\u2019t be trusted. The circular also mentions that the bank must send automatic acknowledgement to such requests with a complaint number.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do a regular follow up.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The intent of regulator is almost always right but the intent needs to be backed up by proper execution. Only time will tell if the bank follow these guidelines (once the guidelines are finalized) in the right spirit.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You take utmost care while using your credit card.
