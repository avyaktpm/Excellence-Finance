The HDFC bank loan can be used by Doctors, Chartered Accountants, Architects and Company Secretaries and other professionals.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, we will discuss a suite of products that is exclusively earmarked for doctors. Bajaj Finserv has 4 loan products for doctors.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal Loan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business Loan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Loan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan against property<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is little to differentiate between the personal loan and the business loan except perhaps for the end use. Therefore, I will club these two products together. The Home loan and loan against property products have similar eligibility criterion but differ on interest rates and charges.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at these loan products from Bajaj Finserv.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Bajaj Finserv Personal Loan\/Business Loan<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available to both consultants and doctors working with Government\/private hospitals and clinics.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personal loan can be taken for any reason except for speculation.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business loans can be taken by only those who need funds to further their practice (purchase medical equipment, pay staff salary, training, renovate, expand their clinic etc.) or those who want to start their medical practice.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan amount is Rs 30 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>No security\/collateral required. No guarantor required.<\/li>\n<li>As I understand, the loan is available both as a term loan and as an overdraft facility.<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the overdraft limit (Flexi Loan), you can withdraw and repay as many times as possible subject to the loan limit. You merely need to keep paying the interest on a monthly basis to keep the facility regular.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repayment tenure of 12-96 months.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No prepayment charges (in case of term loan). The prepayment amount shall not be less than the value of 3 EMIs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rates keep changing. You can find out the latest interest rate on Bajaj Finserv website. As per the website, the interest rate ranges between 14% and 16% p.a. The processing fee can be up to 2% of the loan amount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Years of experience is considered for eligibility. Minimum years of experience varies based on your qualification.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Eligibility for Personal Loan and Business Loan<\/h3>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4605 alignnone\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/eligibility-personal-loan-and-business-loan.png\" alt=\"eligibility for personal loan and business loan\" width=\"601\" height=\"265\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/eligibility-personal-loan-and-business-loan.png 601w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/eligibility-personal-loan-and-business-loan-300x132.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Home Loans for Doctors<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount: Rs 2 crores.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Repayment Tenure of up to 18 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can take top-up loan on your home loan and use the funds for any purpose as you wish.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No prepayment charges.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>Documentation<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You need to provide medical registration certificate and income documents (bank statements, income tax returns, P&amp;L account statements) for the past two years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest Rates and charges will keep changing. You can check the latest interest rates and charges on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bajajfinserv.in\/home-loan-for-doctors\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bajaj Finserv Website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. As per the website, the interest rate ranges between 8.5% and 9%. The processing fee can be up to 1%.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single premium loan insurance (more like a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/home-loan-protection-plan-what-bank-officials-wont-tell-you\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home Loan Protection plan<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">). You should try to avoid such an insurance plan. It is important that you have adequate life insurance to cover your loan liability. However, it is better to purchase from outside and not through the lender.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Bajaj Finserv Loan against Property<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most aspects are similar to the home loan product; I will list down the differences.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nil prepayment penalty for floating rate loans. 2% for fixed rate loans.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you foreclose the loan, 4% of the outstanding amount shall be charged as penalty. I assume this is not applicable for individuals who have taken a floating rate loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top-up loan not available.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rate of interest: 16% onwards.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Processing fees: 1.5% + taxes.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">There are a few other charges too.
