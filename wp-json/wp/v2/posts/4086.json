Not just that, your credit score has also started being a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/your-credit-score-will-determine-your-home-loan-emi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">determinant in the interest rate you pay<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if you plan to apply for a loan in the near future or foresee the need for a loan in the not-so-distant future, you need to keep an eye on your credit score.\u00a0<\/span>A poor credit score or lack of credit history can jeopardize your chances of getting a loan or a credit card.\u00a0If you have a poor credit score or insufficient credit history, what should you do?\u00a0In this post, I will discuss a few methods to improve\/build your credit score.<\/p>\n<h3>#1 Pay Your Loan EMIs and Credit Card Bills on Time<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is 101 of maintaining a good credit score. You cannot have a good credit score if you do not pay your bills on time. Timeliness of payments should be one of the critical determinants of your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you can\u2019t pay your EMIs and credit card bills on time, forget about a good credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, delay in payments could be because of two reasons.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are lazy and simply not disciplined enough to make payments on time, opt for auto-debit from your bank account.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you regularly find yourself short on money to make payments, you have a much bigger problem at hand. It could be a behavioral problem if you can\u2019t resist the urge to spend. Or it could be a financial problem where the numbers simply don\u2019t add up i.e. your cash flows are simply not enough to support such debt payments. In such a case, you need to take some<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-to-get-out-of-debt-trap\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">remedial measures<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Check Your Credit Report<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can find a solution to the problem unless you know there is a problem. You must check your credit report regularly and get any discrepancies rectified. Yes, sometimes, you may get penalised for no fault of yours.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you can <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/check-your-free-credit-report-before-applying-for-a-loan\/\"><b>download one credit report (per credit bureau) per calendar year absolutely free of cost<\/b><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Therefore, keep a tab on your credit score (report) on a regular basis.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are any errors,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cibil.com\/dispute-resolution\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">raise a dispute with CIBIL<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (or any other credit bureau). Do note CIBIL will only forward your request to the concerned credit institution. A credit bureau will make changes to your report only on confirmation from the concerned credit institution (say, the bank).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, in case of any discrepancies, do get in touch with the concerned bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#3 Figure out the Reason for a Poor Credit Score<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In continuation with the above point, there could be genuine reasons for a low credit score (and not just a discrepancy).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is the poor score due to late (or missed) payments or due to high utilization?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the calculation of credit score is done using proprietary methods, it is easier to understand the late payments will affect your credit score adversely.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, many a times, we underestimate<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/cibil-score-understand-how-it-affects-your-loan-application\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the importance of higher credit utilization ratio<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on our credit score. A consistently high credit balance indicates higher repayment burden. This may affect your credit score adversely. Perhaps, with this knowledge at your disposal, you may be able to bring down utilization levels. Alternatively, you can ask the bank to increase your credit limit or<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/credit-card-churning-is-it-a-good-idea\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">apply for another card<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (of course, there are many caveats).<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#4 Take Credit Card against Fixed Deposit<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, we are running into a chicken and egg problem. If you already hold a credit card and have a running loan, you can be regular with your payments and your credit score should gradually improve.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you do not have any credit history and finding it difficult to access for this reason, it may be a good idea to go for secured debt. For instance, you can open a fixed deposit and take a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/credit-card-against-bank-fixed-deposit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">credit card against the fixed deposit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Since the credit is secured, banks wouldn\u2019t have much problem in giving this credit card to you.\u00a0<\/span>Spend on that card responsibly and make your card payments on time.<\/p>\n<h3>#5 Too Many Credit Enquiries Will Affect Your Score<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you apply for a loan or a credit card, the bank (or the credit institution) access your credit score as part of the sanction process. Such enquiries for credit score are called hard enquiries.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Too many<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/cibil-score-understand-how-it-affects-your-loan-application\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">hard enquiries<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> demonstrate credit hungry behavior on your part. Such behavior is unlikely to go down well with the credit bureaus.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for credit, just don\u2019t start applying indiscriminately. Do your research and finalise a couple of lenders before approaching them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#6 Seek Professional Help<\/h3>\n<p>You can also approach a credit repair agencies to help you with building credit score. Since you have spent money to access their service, it is possible that you will be more inclined to follow their suggestions.\u00a0However, the problem lies in identifying the right agency. There are many that offer quick solution to your credit score problems. It is good to stay away from such players. Rebuilding your credit score is a gradual process and can\u2019t be done overnight.<\/p>\n<h3>#7 Don&#8217;t Close Old Credit Card Accounts<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have read conflicting accounts of whether closing old credit card accounts affects your credit score adversely. Some say the duration of your credit history also affects your credit score. Older accounts have benign effect on your score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This could be due to the reason that your overall card utilization will go up, which may affect your credit score adversely. But again, the reason is not just closure of cards.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the credit score calculation methodology is proprietary and the reason is not very intuitive either, I am not sure if this is true.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your credit score plays an important role in getting your loan\/credit card application approved.
