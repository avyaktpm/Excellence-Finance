While under-construction properties are cheaper and offer greater potential for capital appreciation, such properties also come with an element of uncertainty. What if the builder fails to deliver the property on time? Or from what many buyers across the country have faced, the builder fails to deliver altogether? Your money is stuck. You must keep paying the EMI and bear the mental agony. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can this risk be taken care off through a financial product? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To an extent, yes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The State Bank of India (SBI) has launched an innovative home loan scheme <\/span><b>(Residential Builder Finance with Buyer Guarantee, RBBG)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in January 2020, where some of your concerns could be addressed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Does SBI Residential Builder Finance with Buyer Guarantee (RBBG) Work?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the scheme, if the developer fails to deliver the project under the stipulated deadline, the bank will refund the loan principal amount to the buyer (home loan borrower). As I understand, the total disbursed amount will be given back (and not just the outstanding amount). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buyer can use the refund amount to close the loan and move on. It is fair to assume that the purchase interest in the property will also be foregone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This loan product won\u2019t be available for all the projects. <\/span><b>The loan will be available for select projects approved by SBI under the loan scheme.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can expect only projects from \u201creputed\u201d builders to pass the eligibility test. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan scheme is available for projects with a maximum unit price of up to Rs 2.5 crores. The guarantee works until the project receives the occupation certificate. The completion deadline shall be as specified during RERA registration. S<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BI must be the sole lender for the project, both to the builder and the home buyers. If you have borrowed from another lender, the guarantee won\u2019t kick in. As I understand, there will be a tripartite agreement between the buyer (borrower), builder and the bank to effect such a structure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The SBI refunds only the principal amount in the event of default by the builder. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, the entire disbursed amount (not the current outstanding or the sanctioned amount) will be refunded by the bank. For instance, if you took a home loan of Rs 50 lacs under this scheme and the amount disbursed till date is Rs 40 lacs. Due to your regular EMI payments, your current outstanding is Rs 35 lacs. In case the builder defaults (as per the contract), the SBI will refund you Rs 40 lacs. <\/span><b>However, the interest that you have paid until then is gone.<\/b> <b>Moreover, you must have made down-payment to the builder from your own funds. As I understand that money is gone too.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Therefore, you will still be losing a good amount of money if the builder fails to meet the deadline. However, this is still much better what many home buyers are struggling with in many parts of the country. They have taken the home loan, paid money to the builder and are paying interest on their loans but their dream house is nowhere close to being delivered. This loan scheme provides you an exit option (at a loss) that can save you from such hopeless situations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Pros?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, there is much greater comfort in going for such under-construction projects. Since SBI must pay if the builder defaults, you can expect SBI to monitor the project progress closely. Even if the worst were to happen, you wouldn\u2019t be left stranded and hopeless. You will get a good portion back and you can move on.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>SBI has mentioned that the rate of interest for this loan product will be the same as for a regular home loan.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You do not have to pay anything extra. Therefore, the cost of borrowing does not go up simply because of this cushion (even though the borrowing may go up).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Cons?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no free lunch. Since there is greater buyer comfort, you can expect the property to command a premium in pricing, compared to other similar properties. Do not expect too many builders to meet the eligibility criteria. Expect only the most reputed builders to pass the test. And such builders command pricing premium.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you will think that SBI will keep a tight control on the project progress, the record of banks in monitoring the projects is not something to be proud of. As we have seen above, if the\u00a0 builder defaults, <\/span><b>you do not get your entire money back<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You still lose the interest paid and the down payment amount. Therefore, you still need to be cautious.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How long does it take to get the refund amount? The definition of default can be very subjective per se. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a buyer, you also need to see how SBI considers the refund of capital.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the scheme, the SBI also offers loans up to Rs 400 crores to the builders. It remains to be seen how the defaults will be accounted for. As I understand, the builder refunds the loan amount and SBI, as the banker to the builder, provides the builders with the funds to refund the disbursed amount. Let\u2019s say the homebuyer invokes the guarantee. SBI gives funds to the builder who makes the payment (disbursed loan amount, Rs 40 lacs in our example above) to the homebuyer. Now, this Rs 40 lacs becomes a loan from the bank to the builder and the builder must repay it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the moment, there are various unknowns too. Does SBI have project wise refund limits? How long does it take to get the refund amount? What constitutes a default as per the loan contract? The definition of default can be very subjective. Addition or deletion of a word can mean day and night difference between your perception of your rights and reality. You need to understand such finer points too before signing up.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>In my opinion, it is good that such a product has come to the market.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Though it is at a very small level right now, we can look forward to other banks following suits if the State Bank of India has done it. If other banks start doing it too, it can give serious fillip to the real estate market. Having said that, the problems of real estate are not just limited to delivery of projects but that\u2019s a topic for another day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What do you think of SBI\u2019s new home loan product?<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you wary of buying an under-construction property?
