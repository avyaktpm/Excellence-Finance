Now, with rising salaries and easy availability of home loans, you do not need to wait till your late 40s and 50s to purchase a house. Many want to take it to the other extreme and want to purchase a house very early into their professional careers. If you are into your 20s, have just started working and plan to purchase a house on a home loan, these are a few things that you should keep in mind.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#1 Affordability<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to see if you can actually afford an EMI. Banks do a bit of this work for you. You will only get loan to the extent that the EMI (for all the loans combined) does not exceed a certain percentage (say 40%) of your salary.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you can\u2019t let everything to the banks. You need to do some homework too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank will make a fair assessment of your loan EMIs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, you know the best about your regular expenses. You need to see if you want to go for<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/pre-emi-vs-full-emi-which-is-better\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pre-EMI or Full EMI.<\/span><\/a>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have purchased an under-construction property, you will have to manage both home rent and loan EMI. If you took an education loan for your studies, those EMIs also need to be repaid.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these can jointly create a lot of cash flow pressure.\u00a0<\/span><b>If a major portion of your income goes towards your home loan EMI, you may not be left with much to invest for your other goals.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Moreover, a home loan is long term commitment which can run up to 15-20 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#2 Job Stability<\/h3>\n<p><b>If you are in a stable job<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you may find it easier to get a home loan. And it is not just about getting home loan. It is about servicing it too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You wouldn\u2019t want to be in a position where you lose your job and have a huge loan liability on your head.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you are in a well paying job with a startup and may take a loan based on your current income. However, in case of a job loss, it is quite possible you may not be able to find another job that pays as much.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, if you are still exploring your career choices, you need to see if other options give you similar stability.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not suggesting that you should be very conservative with your career choices. However, if you are picking up a liability, this is an aspect worth considering.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#3 Down Payment<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you plan to take a home loan to purchase your first house, you will still need to make some payment from your bank account. Bank will finance only up to 75-80% of the purchase cost of the house.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if you plan to purchase a house quite early into your career, it is better to start saving early for down-payment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#4 Credit Score<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/cibil-score-understand-how-it-affects-your-loan-application\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> plays an important role in your loan sanction process. A poor credit may spoil your chances of getting a home loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recently,<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/your-credit-score-will-determine-your-home-loan-emi\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a PSU bank linked interest rate for your home loan to your CIBIL score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Higher the CIBIL Credit Score, lower the interest rate and EMI. You can expect other banks to follow suit.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you need a good credit history.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, if you have been planning to take a home loan, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.bankbazaar.com\/credit-card.html\">apply for a credit card<\/a>, if you already don\u2019t have one. <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/five-advantages-of-using-a-credit-card\/\">Use the credit card judiciously<\/a> and pay all your bills on time. This will help you build a good credit history.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many youngsters may go overboard with excessive purchases on their credit card and find it difficult to pay credit card bills on time. This will compromise your chances of getting a home loan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, I do not mean you should not care about your credit score if you do not plan to take a loan in the near future.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your credit score is assuming greater importance even in areas not remotely related to loans. For instance, I had to furnish my credit report to SEBI while applying for RIA license.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knows your next prospective employer may ask for it too?<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#5 Guarantor<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes, depending upon assessment of your loan repayment ability, you may be asked to get someone to stand guarantor to your home loan. For instance, if you have a low credit score, banks may doubt your repayment ability. In such cases, you may have to find a family member or a trusted friend to provide guarantee.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is no easy job. If you cannot repay the loan on time, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/signing-up-as-loan-guarantor-beware-of-risks\/\">bank can ask the guarantor to make payments<\/a>. Moreover, the credit score of the guarantor will be affected if you default on your loans. Therefore, the guarantor has a bigger headache.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Personally, I would not take a loan where somebody else has to provide guarantee. I wouldn\u2019t want to put someone else\u2019s financial life at risk if I cannot make the payment. I would rather try with another lender or wait for some time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>#6 Reduces Your Options<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not uncommon to see young professionals go for higher education after working for a few years. You rush to purchase a house under family compulsions and seeing your office colleagues booking a house in a new project.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You take a home loan and start paying EMIs.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if you subsequently decide or want to pursue higher studies? What will you do then?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who will pay your EMIs while you take a break from work for studies? You do not get moratorium for home loan repayment.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is not just limited to higher studies. A loan can take away other career flexibility too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you may have to think many times if you want to switch from a stable job to a startup if you have a big loan outstanding.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This post is not about whether you should purchase a house early in your professional career. And <\/span><b>there is nothing wrong in purchasing a house early in your career.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If nothing else, it forces some budgeting and saving discipline in you. And this discipline is missing in many youngsters.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If yours is a dual income household, you and your spouse may jointly take a loan and even if one of you has to take break from work for any reason, the other person can continue paying the EMI provided it is affordable on a single salary.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, there are certain practical issues that you must be aware of. And you better be aware.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In our parents\u2019 generation, many had to wait almost till retirement to own a house.
