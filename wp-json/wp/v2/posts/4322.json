There are many ways to arrange funds. You can seek short term assistance from a friend or family. There is an option of gold loan or a property loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are young, you can apply for a personal loan. However, what if you are retired and living on a pension? You may feel that a personal loan is out of bounds for such people. This is not entirely true.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, we will discuss a personal loan product that has specifically been structured for pensioners. We will talk about SBI Pension Loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan is available to state and central Government pensioners, Defence pensioners and even family pensioners (spouse authorized to receive pension after death of the pensioner).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>SBI Pension Loan: Eligibility<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be a Central Government or a State Government or a Defence pensioner (or a family pensioner). Defence pensioner include Army, Navy, Air Force, Paramilitary forces (CRPF, BSF, CISF, ITBP etc), Coast Guards, Rashtriya Rifles and Assam Rifles.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I understand, if you are drawing pension from private firm, you won\u2019t be eligible for this loan product.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must not be more than 76 years of age. This restriction applies to family pensioner too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>For defence pensioners, it is specifically mentioned that there is no minimum age.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is no particular mention of minimum age for other pensioners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be drawing pension through one of SBI branches.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have to give an irrevocable undertaking that you will not change your bank branch for receipt of pension. And treasury (that pays the pension) must acknowledge your request. This is to ensure that you route your pension through SBI.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>SBI Pension Loan: Salient Features<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nil processing fee for Defence pensioners.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMIs will be recovered from your pension account.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prepayment penalty of 3% on the prepaid amount.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the pension loan is prepaid from the proceeds of a new loan under the same scheme (SBI Pension Loan), then no prepayment penalty shall be charged. This feature can be useful if the interest rate has moved down from the time when you took the first loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no need to purchase any loan insurance.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get more details about the product on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sbi.co.in\/portal\/web\/personal-banking\/loans-to-pensioners\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Much Loan Can You Get under SBI Pension Loan?

You wouldn\u2019t get funds at this rate from informal market.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, the loan repayment will put stress on your monthly cash flows. At that age, there may not be too many options to increase income. Inflation is already a problem for most pensioners.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is important that you plan well before you retire. Before retiring, ensure that you don\u2019t just have pension as your only source of income. Plan a contingency fund. Do not just invest in income-creating assets. Invest in growth assets too.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there is no other option, you can go for this loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Anyone can face a financial emergency or may need funds to tide over a crisis.
