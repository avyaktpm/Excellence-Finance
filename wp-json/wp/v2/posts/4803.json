The fintech company sells loans and credit cards. The article pointed out many issues with health insurance, most of which were valid. Then, the article pointed out how a medical loan did not suffer from such issues and is thus better than a health insurance policy. That\u2019s where it got all messed up. In my opinion, it is one of the most insipid pieces of financial advice that I have come across. To be fair to the fintech company, there were not hard-selling anything. However, they did provide a spin that benefited them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s first look at the problems with health insurance plans. Then, we discuss how medical loans, albeit a useful product, can\u2019t be an alternative.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Issues with the Health Insurance Plans?<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is clear lack of trust. You pay premium regularly for years. When you make a claim, your claim gets rejected for a minor technical reason. By the way, even that reason may not be justified and may have been made up by the insurance company. Therefore, despite having health insurance, you can never be sure if your next claim will be honoured.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The premium goes up every year. Many times, the premium goes up by 30-40%. Yes, insurance companies employ loopholes in regulations to do. They can discontinue your existing plan and force you to move to a more expensive plan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have not made a claim, there is always this grudge that your premium payments are going waste.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does not cover all types of expenses. Cosmetic treatments are not covered. HIV\/AIDS related treatments are not covered.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is difficult for elderly or applicants with pre-existing ailments to get health insurance in the first place. Mostly, such applications are either rejected or the premium made prohibitively expensive.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may prefer to get treated at cheaper and smaller medical establishments. However, those hospitals may not be covered under your health plan.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not difficult to see that your health insurance plan can let you down. Even then, does that mean that you do not purchase health insurance when you can?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance industry is built upon the concept that the insured events are adverse events. Such events affect you adversely. So, you wouldn\u2019t want to experience these events just to make a claim. It takes just one event to realize the importance of medical coverage. You have been paying Rs 20,000 per annum towards health insurance coverage of Rs 5 lacs. No claims made for 10 years. Rs 2 lacs gone down the hole. In the 11<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year, you make a claim of Rs 5 lacs. You wouldn\u2019t feel as bad about your decision to purchase health cover, would you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, from the perspective of financial planning, a health insurance fills a gap (or gives that impression). There is no other way to do it.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Can Medical Loan Help?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A medical loan is a fine product. It can offer you quick access to funds in times of need. You may be able to get discounts on hospital bills. It can be a life saver. It can help you or your family get the quality of medical treatment that you want. A medical loan is quite like a personal loan. The only difference is in the way the payment is made and how the repayment is structured. The payment is typically made directly to the hospital (and not to you). For more on medical loans and how these loans work, refer to <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/should-you-opt-for-medical-loans\/\">this post<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>However, a medical loan can\u2019t still be a replacement for health insurance. <\/b><b>Why?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under health insurance, you pay Rs 20,000 and get cover of Rs 5 lacs. Insurance company takes care of the treatment cost up to Rs 5 lacs. You are out by only Rs 20,000. With a medical loan, if you take a loan of Rs 5 lacs, you must pay back say Rs 5.5 lacs. Compare <\/span><b>Rs 20,000 vs Rs 5.5 lacs<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may argue that Rs 20,000 must be paid every year irrespective of whether you make the claim or not. You will take a medical loan only when the event happens. Fair enough. However, have you considered the risk involved? <strong>Rs 5.5 lacs could have been used to pay health insurance premium for over 25 years (assuming premium remains constant)<\/strong>. Another way to look at it is that if you put Rs 5.5 lacs in a fixed deposit, the interest from that fixed deposit may be enough to fund the annual premium for life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if you acquire an illness that requires regular hospitalization? Health insurance coverage will reset every year. So, you can use the same policy to make payments for the same illness year after year. Remember, insurance regulations do not allow insurance companies to <a href=\"https:\/\/timesofindia.indiatimes.com\/business\/personal-finance\/Renewing-policy-Company-cant-hike-premium\/articleshow\/20962257.cms\">hike premium<\/a> or <a href=\"http:\/\/www.policyholder.gov.in\/Renewability_of_Health_Insurance.aspx\">refuse to renew your policy<\/a> just because you made a claim in the previous year. How many medical loans will you take, or will you be able to get? After all, these medical loans need to be repaid too. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if you don\u2019t get a medical loan? It is not that a medical loan is your right. What if your credit score is not good? What if your salary can\u2019t support the quantum of loan sought? How will you or your family fund the treatment?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Do You Do?<\/h2>\n<p><b>If you don\u2019t trust insurance companies, the alternative is to build up a medical emergency fund.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A fund that you can bank upon to fund hospitalization and medical expenses for the family members. You can accumulate this money in fixed deposit or a liquid fund. By the way, if you contract an ailment that requires regular hospitalization, your medical fund can deplete very fast unless it is quite big. However, you may still want to play with the odds.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>A medical loan can\u2019t be a strategy.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It can\u2019t be a replacement for your health insurance or medical fund. A medical loan comes into picture when your first line (health insurance) and second line of defence (medical fund) are depleted. And that is how you should think about it. It can also be a good option when you must first pay from your pocket and then file for reimbursement with the health insurance company. However, it can\u2019t be your sole vehicle to fund expensive medical treatments. That won\u2019t be good planning.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We know that Financial institutions can do many things to sell their products.
