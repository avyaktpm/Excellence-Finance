And why not? We keep hearing or reading about new and innovative ways of perpetrating card and UPI frauds on unsuspecting account holders. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the fraudsters are usually a step ahead of us and the regulations, a little bit of awareness can help still guard against frauds. Moreover, even if you became a victim, awareness about the rules can reduce the extent of damage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways to handle this.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b><\/b><b>Avoid frauds. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Common sense advice \u2014 Do not share card details or net banking details with anyone. Do not share OTPs. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">You do not need OTP or UPI PIN to receive money but only to transfer money.<\/span> Do not use credit\/debit cards on public or unsafe computers.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a victim, <\/span><b>reduce the impact of fraud<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You need to report the fraud quickly. This will reduce your liability. The sooner you report the fraudulent transaction to the bank, the better it is.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Further Reading<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/reducing-the-impact-of-a-credit-card-fraud\/\">Reducing the Impact of a Credit Card Fraud<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/use-paytm-or-amazon-pay-what-is-you-liability-in-a-fraud\/\">Use PayTM or Amazon Pay? What Is You Liability in a Fraud?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to all the above, RBI came out with a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11788&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circular to enhance security of card transactions earlier this year<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Suggest you go through the circular to know more about your rights. I wrote about the changes in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/rbi-enhances-the-security-of-credit-and-debt-cards\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This will help both prevent frauds and reduce the damage in case of a fraud.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Can You Do Prevent Fraud?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bank shall provide you facility (through mobile add or website) to:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Enable\/disable all transactions<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you don\u2019t use your card, then just disable all transactions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Lock\/unlock domestic or international transactions.\u00a0 <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not travelling abroad, just disable international transactions on your card.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>You can set daily transaction limits or you can set per transaction limits.<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, you can set up a daily transaction limit of Rs 20,000 and per transaction limit of Rs 10,000. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In such a case, if the bank receives a transaction request of Rs 11,000, it will be rejected (greater than per transaction limit). OR if your bank receives 3 requests on your credit\/debit card in the following order on the same day: Rs. 9,000, Rs. 8,000 and Rs 5,000: The third transaction of Rs. 5,000 will be rejected because the daily limit of Rs 20,000 gets breached with the third transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not just that, you can set these limits (daily and per transaction) for various types of transaction.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Point of sale<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Online Transactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ATM Transactions<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contactless transactions<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is what my credit card issuing bank allows:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Set daily limits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Point of sale transactions, online transactions and ATM transactions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Set per transaction limits<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for Point of Sale transactions, online transactions, ATM transactions and contactless transactions. <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">The per transaction limits can be set separately for domestic and international transactions<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. For instance, you can set different online transaction limits for domestic and international transactions.<\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adjust these limits real-time through the mobile app.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4><strong>How Do You Use This Facility?<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your usage, you can set up limits for various types of transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you use your card for mostly online transactions, you can simply set your Point of sale transaction limit to zero or to a very nominal amount (say Rs 1,000).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OR <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not use your credit\/debit card for online transactions, you can block online transactions (set online transaction limit to zero). You can set either the daily online transaction limit or per online transaction limit to zero. Both will serve the same purpose. Many senior citizens use a debit card for ATM withdrawals, and sometimes can be easy prey. You can help them set per transaction limit (for online transactions) to zero. You can set limits for other kind of transactions too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">OR <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you own two credit cards, you can use one card for point-of-sale transactions (and block it for online transactions). You can use the second card for online transactions (and block it for Point of sale transactions).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t have to do it exactly in the manner suggested above, but you get the idea. You can set daily\/per transaction limits as per your preference.<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><strong>Bank Implementation Varies<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand your bank may not provide all these features. I checked on the mobile app of the bank, where I hold the savings account (debit card). The app allows users to enable or disable domestic\/international transactions. In addition, it allows to set up limits for ATM or POS\/e-commerce transactions. There was no bifurcation for POS and e-commerce transactions. A single limit for both types of transactions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, the bank is not implementing the RBI directions properly. Copying excerpt from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11788&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI circular on enhancing security for card transactions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Additionally, the issuers shall provide to all cardholders \u2014 facility to switch on \/ off and set \/ modify transaction limits (within the overall card limit, if any, set by the issuer) for all types of transactions \u2013 domestic and international, at PoS \/ ATMs \/ online transactions \/ contactless transactions, etc.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creative interpretation. Game of punctuation, I guess. I need to reach out to the bank for better clarity.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, my credit card issuing bank did a far better and honest job.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan to set up transaction limits for your credit or debit card?
