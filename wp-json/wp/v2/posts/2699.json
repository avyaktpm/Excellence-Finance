EMI schemes with credit card purchases are now being extended to newer segments such as education, hotels &amp; resorts and insurance. With these, volumes are now back to the levels seen during the height of 0% EMI schemes. Credit cards are now issued after rigorous checks to reduce risk of defaults as cardholders increasingly opt for EMI facility on purchases.<\/p>\n<p>Although convenient, consumers need to be aware of the following disadvantages:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>If credit card is used to <a title=\"EMI at point-of-sale through credit cards gaining momentum\" href=\"http:\/\/www.thehindu.com\/business\/Industry\/emi-at-pointofsale-through-credit-cards-gaining-momentum\/article5979250.ece\" target=\"_blank\">pay college fees instead of education loan<\/a>, you would lose the advantage of moratorium period and income tax deductions. Education loans also tend to have longer repayment tenures of 10-12 years when compared to credit card repayment terms.<\/li>\n<li>Opting for EMI on any purchase would likely mean loss of reward points on those credit card purchases.<\/li>\n<li>You will incur pre-payment charges on the outstanding amount if you wish to foreclose the EMI facility. Also, closing the credit card account during this period attracts other penalties.<\/li>\n<li>You could also pay higher interest if you default on your monthly minimum due on the credit card. Non-payment of minimum due, which includes monthly EMI amount, will result in late fees and higher interest being levied on the outstanding amount.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Remember \u20180% EMI\u2019 schemes?
