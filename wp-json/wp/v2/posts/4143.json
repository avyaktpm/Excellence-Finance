Pre-payment penalty of 2% in case of pre-payment in fixed rate loans<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the loan is being offered to middle and low income segment, you can expect the interest rates for his loan to be slightly higher. This is to compensate for the higher risk taken by the bank. You can check the latest loan rates<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/home-loan\/asha-home-loan\/interest-rates-charges\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get up to 12 EMI waived under the loan scheme (more on this later)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can avail benefit under Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme under<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/emicalculator.net\/credit-linked-subsidy-scheme-for-first-time-home-buyers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I am sure there will many other unwritten criteria (at least not mentioned on the website). For instance, There is no mention of the maximum age at the time of loan maturity.<\/p>\n<h3>Loan Eligibility Can Be Misleading<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned in my post on <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/pnb-housing-unnati-home-loan-scheme\/\">PNB Unnati scheme<\/a>, you need to be practical about your loan eligibility. It is unlikely you will get a loan of Rs 28 lacs at a monthly income of Rs 10,000.\u00a0The bank will also consider your repayment ability. There is no way you can repay loan of 28 lacs at a monthly income of Rs 10,000 unless you have other sources of income.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Rs 28 lacs loan at an interest rate of 9.75% (this is the minimum rate mentioned currently on the Axis Bank website) and loan tenure of 30 years, the EMI will be Rs 24,056.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering Axis Bank is comfortable with Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio (FOIR) of 50%, your monthly income needs to be at least Rs 48,112 before you can think about getting the maximum loan amount.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At an income of say Rs 10,000 per month, you will not get a loan which is more than Rs. 6-8 lacs (even after considering subsidy under PMAY).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>This brings me to another point. If you have to take a loan of up to Rs 28 lacs and can actually afford it (you have an income of about Rs 50,000 per month), why not go for a regular home loan scheme? Your interest rate will be much lower.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, for Axis Bank Fast Forward loan, the minimum loan size is Rs 30 lacs and the interest rate is much lower (6 month MCLR + 0.20% for salaried customers). Contrast this with MCLR + 1.60% for salaried customers in case of Asha Home Loan Scheme.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am sure Axis Bank may have slightly relaxed eligibility criteria under Asha Home loan. However, this is still an aspect you must think about.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>EMI Loan Waiver<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 12 EMIs will be waived if you maintain clean repayment record.\u00a0<\/span>4 EMIs shall be waived off at the end of 4th, 8th and 12th year.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will get this waiver only if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are only up to 3 instances of dues pending for 30 days and above AND<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No instance of dues pending for over 90 days during the life of the loan AND<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The minimum tenure of the loan shall not be less than 20 years at the time of disbursement<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Needless to say, your loan should be alive for 4, 8 or 12 years for you to avail this tax benefit.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note this EMI waiver comes in the form of tenure reduction towards the end of the loan tenure. It is not that you don\u2019t have to pay EMIs for 4 months after 4<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 8<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and 12<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s assume you take a 20 year loan. The interest rate does not change during the term and you do not make any pre-payment during the porting scheme. If you satisfy the other conditions, you loan tenure will go down as 19 years.\u00a0This will bring down effective pre-tax cost of the loan.\u00a0There are a few caveats with the waiver facility. I have discussed various aspects of EMI waiver in the post of <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/axis-bank-fast-forward-home-loan-get-12-emis-waived-off\/\">Axis Bank Fast Forward Home loan scheme<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Good Points and the Points I Am Not Very Clear About<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned in PNB Unnati scheme, you get a loan tenure of up to 30 years, which can reduce the EMI amount but increase the absolute interest outgo.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though fixed rate option is available under the Axis Bank Asha Home Loan scheme, the number of years for which the loan will stay fixed rate is not specified. For PNB Unnati scheme, the fixed rate option was available for 3, 5 and 10 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no difference in eligibility for salaried and self-employed professionals.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Does the PNB Housing Finance Unnati Scheme Fares against Other Products?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I reproduce the comparison table used in comparing PNB Housing Unnati and Asha Home Loan Scheme.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><b>Features<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>PNB Housing Unnati Scheme<\/b><\/td>\n<td><b>Axis Bank Asha Home Loan<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25 lacs<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20-28 lacs depending on the location<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan as % of Property value<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 90% for salaried,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67% for self-employed<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 85% of the property value<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Tenure<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 years<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMI Waiver<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 12 EMIs, subject to conditions<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Monthly Income<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10,000<\/span><\/td>\n<td><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8,000-10,000 depending on the location<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to comparing two loan products, everything else being same, go with the one that offers you the lower interest rate.
