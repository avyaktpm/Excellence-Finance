It is also evident in the examples that we use for various illustrations in our posts. Earlier, we used 9-10% p.a. for long term loans. Now, we use 7-8% p.a. in the illustrations. If you use Amazon or Flipkart, you would have noticed that if your purchase exceeds a certain threshold, you can purchase the product on EMIs. Of course, you need to own a credit card from a partner bank.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A friend had 2 questions on the EMI purchases.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why No-cost EMI is not available for longer tenures? You will see these loans for only up to 6-9 months. If you want a longer duration loan, you must opt for a regular loan (interest-based).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those interest-based loans, the interest cost has not come down. It was 13-15% p.a. before. It is 13-15% p.a. even now. Shouldn\u2019t the rates be lower for such loans too?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The answer to the first question is quite crisp. The answer to the second question is a bit subjective.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">About No-cost EMI loan, a loan of longer duration will be unaffordable to the bank\/e-tailer\/seller. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have discussed this before in a post on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/how-banks-manage-to-provide-no-cost-emi-on-e-commerce-websites\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No-cost EMIs<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A quick brief of how No-cost EMIs work.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\">No-cost EMIs are regular interest-based loans. In fact, zero interest rate loans are not permitted under RBI regulations. To provide a no-cost EMI (zero interest rate) experience, you are offered an upfront discount equivalent to interest cost.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us say you make a purchase of Rs 50,000.\u00a0 You opt for 6-month No-cost EMI. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will pay Rs 8,333 (50,000 \/ 6) for 6 months.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, the upfront discount will be calculated such that the EMI comes to Rs 8,333. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the bank uses an interest rate of 15% for the loan, it can easily do a back-calculation to figure out the discount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interest rate =15% p.a., Tenure = 6 months, EMI= 8,333<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can use the PV function in excel to figure out the loan amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PV (15%\/12, 6 months, 8,333,0,0) = Rs 47,883<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>Upfront Discount= Rs 50,000 \u2013 Rs 47,883 = Rs 2,117<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will be given this upfront discount. Your credit card will be charged only Rs 47,883.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>Hence, an upfront discount, followed by a regular interest-based loan gives a No-cost EMI experience.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Now, the question to ask is \u2014 Who bears this upfront discount? <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While I cannot say with certainty, it is likely shared between the seller on Amazon \/ Flipkart and the bank, with the seller likely forced to share bulk of the responsibility. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>How is all this math relevant to our original question?<\/p>\n<h2>#1 Why No-Cost EMI Option Is Not Available for Longer Tenure?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>This is relevant because the upfront discount depends on the loan tenure.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>No-cost EMI Tenure<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\"><strong>Upfront Discount<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">3 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 1,224<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">6 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 2,117<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">9 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 2,986<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">12 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 3,836<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">18 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 5,473<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">24 months<\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 50%;\">Rs 7,032 (which is 14% of item cost of Rs 50,000)<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p>And someone needs to bear that cost to provide you No-cost EMI experience.\u00a0As the loan tenure of No-cost EMI loans increases, the quantum of upfront discount goes up. Such a high discount may not be sustainable. For this reason, no-cost EMIs are usually for shorter tenures.<\/p>\n<h2>#2 Why Has the Cost of Regular EMI Loans Not Gone Down?<\/h2>\n<p>Its still around 13-15% p.a.\u00a0I cannot comment on this aspect with certainty, but I will try to present an argument.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I think this is because the banks do not charge a processing fee on these loans. With no processing fee, the interest rates must be higher to adequately compensate the banks. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/when-you-are-hunting-for-a-loan-look-beyond-interest-rates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">discussed<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before that the <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>processing fee impacts the overall cost of a <\/strong><\/span><\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>short-term loan<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong> in a significant way<\/strong><\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuing with the above example, let us go with a regular loan for 24 months (Interest:15% p.a., Loan Amount: Rs 50,000, Tenure: 12 months). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">EMI will be Rs 4,513. Over the next 12 months, the bank will earn total interest income of Rs 4,154 (4,513 x 12 \u2013 50,000).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the bank could charge a processing fee of 2%, to earn the same amount of income, it would have to charge only 11.45% p.a. (instead of 15% p.a.). In this case, <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>the bank is not charging any processing fee, hence the interest rate must be kept higher.<\/strong><\/span> <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We must also note that credit card loans are unsecured loans and hence must be priced accordingly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand that I am not defending the banks\u2019 decision to charge high interest rate on credit card loans on e-commerce websites. I cannot comment on what is an adequate compensation for banks in a loan. As I see, small ticket loans for short tenures yield very little interest income in absolute terms.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, for such loans,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in absence of processing fee, a higher interest rate is perhaps the only way to make this a fruitful engagement for the bank.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Loan interest rates have been going down over the past 18 months.
