The Reserve Bank notified the change in its<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/Scripts\/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11677&amp;Mode=0\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">circular dated September 4, 2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This means MCLR will soon be history, at least for retail borrowers. Starting October 1, no new floating rate loans will be linked to MCLR. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What could be the external benchmarks? If you are an existing borrower under Base Rate or MCLR, what should you do? What are the other aspects you must keep in mind? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>The External Benchmark Need Not Just Be the Repo Rate<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In July, 2019, the State Bank of India had launched a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/sbi-to-launch-repo-rate-linked-home-loan-product-in-july-2019\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home loan product<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> linked to Repo rate (an external benchmark). The Benchmark is called RLLR (Repo Linked Loan Rate). RLLR is RBI Repo Rate + 2.25%. The loans were offered spread over RLLR. Therefore, RLLR was withdrawn and a new benchmark (External benchmark-linked rate) was launched towards the end of September, 2019. Even though the linkage is to the Repo, the benchmark spread has been increased to 2.65%.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citibank has a home loan product where the interest rate benchmark is<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/citibank-launches-home-loans-linked-to-3-month-treasury-rates\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3-month Treasury yield<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This product was launched way back in March 2018, much before RBI notified this change.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your bank can choose any of the above external rates as the benchmark.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RBI Repo Rate<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government of India 3-Months or 6-months Treasury Bill yield published by the Financial Benchmarks India Private Ltd (FBIL)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any other benchmark market interest rate published by the FBIL<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Your bank may have already launched similar home loan product. From what I have seen, most of the banks are using RBI Repo rate as the external benchmark.<\/p>\n<h2>I Have an Existing Home Loan. Can I Switch to EBR or the External Benchmark Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are a new borrower, you don\u2019t have any choice since your loan will be linked to an external benchmark. However, if you are an existing borrower and your loan is linked to MCLR or base rate, you will get an option to switch to external benchmark. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As per the RBI circular, <\/span><b>if your loan is a floating rate loan and has no prepayment penalty<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will get an option to switch to the external benchmark. It won\u2019t happen automatically. You will have to request your bank. <\/span><b>Remember switch from Base Rate or MCLR to an external benchmark is a one-way street. You can\u2019t switch back.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Should I Switch from MCLR\/Base Rate to Repo Rate or Any Other External Benchmark?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When MCLR regime was introduced a few years back, many of us had to make a similar decision. Should you switch to the new benchmark? MCLR seemed more transparent than the base rate and thus clearly had an upper hand. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The borrowers had to choose between one of the following three.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Maintain the status quo<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> i.e. stick with base rate.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Switch without paying a fee<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In this case, your pre-switch and post-switch interest rate remained the same. i.e., the spread was adjusted to keep the interest rate constant. For instance, if your loan interest rate was 9% p.a. under base rate and MCLR was 8.25%, your spread will be 0.75%. Had the loan interest rate been 8.75%, your spread would have been 0.5% p.a. I have highlighted the <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/do-not-ignore-spread-while-switching-from-base-rate-to-mclr\/\">issues of a higher spread<\/a> in an earlier post<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Switch after paying a fee to a lower rate<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The fee was a fixed amount in some cases while a percentage of outstanding loan amount in the others. In this case, you could get a lower rate, but you must pay a fee for it. Here, it was all about cost-benefit analysis. You had a cost in the form of fee and the benefit in the form of lower EMI due to lower rate of interest. I have discussed the decision process in detail in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/should-i-switch-my-home-loan-from-base-rate-to-mclr\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">this post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b>What about Base rate\/MCLR to an external benchmark? <\/b><b>RBI circular takes cognisance of this scenario too and mentions the following:<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">[Such borrowers]<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">shall be eligible for switchover to External Benchmark without any charges\/fees, except reasonable administrative\/ legal costs.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I see, there shouldn\u2019t be a significant fee impact even if you were to switch to the external benchmark. Favourable for borrowers. At the same time, the banks may have a very different interpretation of administrative\/legal costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The circular further adds:<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final rate charged to this category of borrowers, post switchover to external benchmark, shall be same as <\/span><b>the rate charged for a new loan of the same category, type, tenor and amount, at the time of origination of the loan<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also important. As I understand, the bank won\u2019t be able to tinker around with your loan spread just to keep the interest same as before the switch. The rate must be in line with what the new borrower will get. In my opinion, this means if a new borrower with your credit profile can get a new loan at 8.25% p.a. and your existing loan is at 8.75% pa., you should also get 8.25% p.a. post the switch. And this should be allowed without any expensive charges. Please note this is my understanding. The banks may have a completely different interpretation of the RBI rules.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I see, you will have 2 options.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maintain status quo. Stick with Base Rate or MCLR.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shift to EBR (for SBI borrowers) or any other benchmark at a very reasonable cost. By the way, \u201cReasonable\u201d may have a different meaning for you and the bank. You know what I mean. Clearly, you will agree to this switch if the externally benchmarked loan is cheaper than your existing loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><b>The decision-making should be fairly simple in such a scenario. If the new loan is lower, switch or you must wait. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, if you aren\u2019t getting a good deal from your bank, you can always explore options outside of your bank. However, changing the lender (refinancing your loan) is operationally challenging. There will be minor additional expenses too. <\/span><b>I assume you find merit in an external benchmark.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>Points to Note<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The RBI circular applies only to the banks. Housing Finance Companies (HFC) such as HDFC, LIC Housing Finance etc.\u00a0 do not have to shift to an external benchmark, as of now. Therefore, if you have taken a home loan from an HFC, you will have to look out if you want to shift to an external benchmark.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Home loans are offered at a Benchmark + Spread. The benchmark keeps changing. Spread will typically remain constant during your loan tenure. Therefore, keep an eye on the spread. <\/span><b>If you happen to contract your loan at a higher spread, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/do-not-ignore-spread-while-switching-from-base-rate-to-mclr\/\">it can pinch you later<\/a>.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0 <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the post is about MCLR spread, the concept remains the same.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The aforesaid RBI circular dated September 4, 2019 applies to only floating rate loans. If your loan is fixed rate loan, nothing changes for you. Makes sense too.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan interest rate under the externally benchmarked loan will be reset at least once in 3 months. SBI EBR loans reset every month. With MCLR, the banks typically kept reset periods at 6 months or 1 year. Shorter reset periods help in quicker monetary policy transmission.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank can use only 1 benchmark for a particular category of loans. For instance, it can\u2019t benchmark a few home loans to Repo and the others to 3-month Treasury yields.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the spread is expected to be constant, the bank can change the spread if there is a change in credit profile. There is a provision that permits change in spread due to change in operating costs once in 3 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Facing this dilemma about switch to external benchmark or not?
