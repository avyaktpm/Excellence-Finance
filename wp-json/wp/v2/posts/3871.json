Beware of Risks"},"content":{"rendered":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your close friend has been planning to buy a house for a long time. However, when he approached the bank to apply for a home loan, bank insisted to getting someone to sign as a guarantor for the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lenders can ask for a financial guarantor if the credit history is weak or repayment ability of the applicant is in doubt.\u00a0The<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0friend requests you to sign up as a guarantor for his home loan. What do you do? You mind says No but you do not want to put your friendship on stake for this PETTY money matter.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What will you do?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bad part is there is no middle path. Either you have to say Yes or you have to say No.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The choice is yours but you must consider the following aspects if you were to sign up as a guarantor for a loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#1\u00a0In case of default, the bank will come after you.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no provision that the bank has to exhaust all the options to recover money from the borrower. The bank can directly approach you.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the borrower does not pay, YOU have to pay. After all, the bank has lent taking comfort from your financial position.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you also need to make an assessment if your friend can repay the loan. In this case, a few subjective parameters such as how responsible your friend is, his skill sets, his earning prowess come into picture. You need to draw upon your experience to make this judgment.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You also need to see if you will be in a position to repay the loan if your friend or relative were to default.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#2\u00a0Your loan eligibility will take a hit.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan guarantee counts against your loan eligibility. Therefore, if you act as guarantor for a loan, your loan eligibility will go down.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are not planning to take another loan in your life, this aspect should not be a problem.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, if you are planning to take a home loan yourself, think twice before signing up as a guarantor.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note a home loan is a long term commitment. Moreover, under reducing balance method, the outstanding loan goes down very slowly during the initial years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a way, your loan eligibility will take a hit for many years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#3\u00a0Your Credit Score is at stake.\u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since even a guarantee counts as your liability, any defaults on the loan will affect your credit score adversely.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does not have to a full fledged default. Even irregular\/delayed payments by the borrower can affect your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a poor credit score, your chances of taking a loan or a credit card may get adversely affected.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We discussed in an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/your-credit-score-will-determine-your-home-loan-emi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> how lenders may start linking loan interest rates to your credit score.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It does not end here.\u00a0<\/span>Your credit score can play a role even in areas remotely related to borrowing.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if you have furnish your credit score when you apply for a club membership?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if employers start asking for credit score along with job applications?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You never know.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#4\u00a0Let emotions take a backseat. \u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you feel that the friend or relative is not that responsible or is likely to struggle with payments, say No to a request to sign up as a guarantor. Make a rational choice.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You do not want to mess up your financial life just because somebody else cannot repay the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing to be defensive about.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, offer help in improving credit history or finding a better paying job.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For all the stupid things that bankers do, they do one thing right. Such are the bank processes that they do not work on trust. Banks do not work on emotions. \u00a0So should you in this case.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Easier said than done.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>#5\u00a0Ensure that your friend or relative has adequate life insurance. \u00a0<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What should you do if you have to or have already signed up as a guarantor for the loan?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to mitigate risk of non-payment of loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your friend or relative may be the most responsible person on earth. However, he can repay loan only so long he is alive. If something were to happen to him, the bank will again come after you to settle the loan.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Banks take care of this part by persuading borrowers to purchase a<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/home-loan-protection-plan-what-bank-officials-wont-tell-you\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">home loan protection plan (HLPP)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If you think an HLPP will take care of this issue, you are quite far from the truth. Consider this<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/another-reason-not-to-opt-for-hlpp\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">example<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you CANNOT rely on banks to help him purchase the right cover. Banks sell all kinds of insipid insurance plans.<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/icici-bank-home-safe-plus-a-review\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ICICI Home Loan Safe Plus<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is a classic example where only accidental death is covered or only critical illness is covered. Perhaps, smart executives at ICICI Bank and ICICI Lombard think that the borrower cannot die of a natural illness. Even consumer courts have taken exception at such poor products.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank has property as security. Bank has guarantor in you. Bank has earned hefty commissions selling your friend a poor insurance product. Bank has everything covered.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What about you?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The least you can do is to urge your friend to purchase the right life insurance plan and follow up on timely renewals. I know it is easier said than done but you do not have any other option.\u00a0<\/span>In fact, your friend or relative should have adequate health cover and disability cover too.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to advise your friend on ring-fencing his finances.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A health cover helps him avoid financial trouble in the event of medical emergency in the family.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A disability cover may help overcome short term loss of income due to temporary disability. Additionally, if the earning potential is compromised due to a permanent disability, proceeds from such a plan can help square off the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your close friend has been planning to buy a house for a long time.
