So during this festival season, the bank offers this reduced interest rate even if the loan amount is above 75 lakhs. Further, non-salaried borrowers can also avail this loan if their credit score is above the said threshold. In short, SBI is giving this offer for all those who have a healthy credit score regardless of loan amount and occupation. The processing fee is also completely waived off.<\/p>\n<h2>HDFC<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.moneycontrol.com\/news\/business\/hdfc-joins-sbi-kotak-and-pnb-to-cut-home-loan-rates-in-festive-offer-7489731.html\">HDFC also offers home loans at 6.7%<\/a> for those who have credit score of above 800 irrespective of loan amount and occupation.
