You spent months finalizing the right property for you. You paid the booking amount from your own pocket. For the remaining purchase amount and construction linked instalments, you are banking on a home loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, your loan application gets rejected or the bank is not willing to sanction the requested amount. The reasons could be wide-ranging. There may be issues with property documents, developer, your credit score or even your income.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whatever the reason may be, you are in some serious trouble. You always have an option to apply to another bank for loan. However, the same issues may crop up there as well.\u00a0<\/span>Now, either you have to manage funds on your own (which is almost impossible for a middle-class family) or you have to cancel the deal. Don\u2019t expect the builder to refund your booking amount.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What can you do to avoid such a scenario?\u00a0You can apply for a pre-approved loan when you begin your search for the property.<\/strong><\/p>\n<h2>What Is a Pre-Approved Home Loan?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pre-approved home loan is an in-principle loan approval from the bank. i.e., the bank promises to give you the loan without even considering the property you want to purchase.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quantum (sanction) of pre-approved home loan is decided based upon your repayment ability and your credit worthiness. Therefore, the bank will decide the quantum of your loan on your income levels, other loans etc.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank looks at two things while sanctioning a home loan to you.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your repayment ability and creditworthiness (this is checked during sanction of pre-approved loan)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality\/genuineness of the project\/property (this is not looked at during sanction of pre-approved loan)\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, by <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/pre-approved-home-loans-what-you-should-know-before-going-for-it\/\">opting for a pre-approved loan<\/a>, you are essentially splitting the loan sanction process into two parts. If you have a pre-approved loan, you can be sure that your final disbursal\/sanction will not be stopped because of the issues at your end (income, credit score etc). Do note it may be stopped for other reasons (discussed later).<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>What Are the Benefits of Pre-Approved Home Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchase of a house is a big-ticket item for almost all of us and we have to take out a loan for the purpose.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your loan is pre-approved, <\/span><b>you know your budget<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It is easier to identify deals that fit your budget.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>You avoid the risk, to some extent, of not getting a home loan after you have finalized the property. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I discussed an example at the beginning of the post.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To a seller, you may appear a more serious buyer. Moreover, the deal can be closed quickly. If you have a pre-approved home loan, <\/span><b>you may be able to negotiate the price of the property better.<\/b><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Are the Issues with Pre-Approved Home Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you have the sanction, the disbursal is still subject to conditions.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, even though you may have the pre-approved loan sanction letter with you, it is not guaranteed that the bank will disburse the loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>#1<\/strong> When the bank pre-approved the loan, it considered your repayment ability. However, <\/span><b>before it disburses the loan, it needs to be sure of the asset (house) too.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Therefore, it is quite possible that the bank is not comfortable with the documents, project approvals etc. For instance, if the legal titles of the property are not clear or requisite approvals are not in place for an under-construction loan, the bank may refuse to disburse the loan amount.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the introduction of RERA (Real Estate Regulation Act), I believe the lack of Government approvals should not be a problem. However, don\u2019t rule issues at the last minute.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#2 The pre-approval is only valid for a few months, typically six months.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you are not able to close the property deal within 6 months, you will have to forfeit the processing fees already paid. Moreover, you will have to go through the entire process again and perhaps even pay the processing fee again.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>#3<\/strong>\u00a0<strong>P<\/strong><\/span><b>otential forfeiture of the processing fee may put pressure to close the deal within stipulated time<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand different banks may have different policies about processing fee. Processing fee is completely bank\u2019s discretion. Therefore, you may even have pre-approved loans where the processing fee is waived off. However, you need to be aware of this aspect.<\/span><\/i><\/p>\n<p><b>#4 Avoid applying to multiple banks for pre-approved loans. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like any other credit product, a formal application sends a hard enquiry to the credit bureau and this can result in a lower credit score. As discussed in many of my earlier posts, a poor credit score can not only derail your loan application but also <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/your-credit-score-will-determine-your-home-loan-emi\/\">result in higher rates of interest<\/a>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>#5 A pre-approved loan blocks your credit limits. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though you have not taken any disbursal, the credit limits will be blocked to the tune of the sanctioned amount.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Should You Consider Pre-Approved Home Loans?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pre-approved home loan has many merits. I see nothing wrong in applying for a pre-approved loan especially when the processing fee is reasonable. The bank where you have your salary account is likely to provide you a good offer.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, pre-approved loans are not for vanity and show-off. Apply only when you are serious about purchasing a property.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, you must understand that it does not take out the entire uncertainty about loan disbursal.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, if<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/check-your-free-credit-report-before-applying-for-a-loan\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">you have been keeping tab on your credit score<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and are sanguine about your loan expectations (with respect to your income levels), I believe you should be able to get a home loan when you apply.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Useful Bank Links<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofbaroda.com\/baroda-pre-approved-home-loan.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank of Baroda: Pre-Approved Home Loan<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/homeloans.sbi\/products\/view\/pre-approved-home-loan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SBI Pre-Approved Home Loan<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You just booked an under-construction property.
