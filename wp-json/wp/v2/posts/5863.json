There is PPF, EPF, NPS, ELSS, LIC policies, ULIPs, 5-year FDs, life and health insurance plans, pension plans and many more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>In this post, I do not intend to discuss the merits and demerits of specific products.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Or which is the best tax-saving product? I just want to discuss how you should approach the selection of tax-saving products this season. Here is a quick checklist.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#1 Your Tax-Savings Will Vary Depending on Your Tax Bracket<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are in 30% tax bracket, tax-saving investment of Rs 1.5 lacs will help you save tax of 45,000 (before cess). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For an investor in 10%, the same investment will result in tax-saving of only Rs 15,000. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I understand that \u201conly\u201d is subjective. Rs 15,000 may mean different to different people. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, <strong>not everyone saves 46,000 by investing Rs 1.5 lacs in ELSS or ULIPs as highlighted in advertisements.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#2 Consider Automatic Tax-Savings Too<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your contribution to your EPF account counts towards Section 80C limit of Rs 1.5 lacs.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The tuition fee that you pay for your children\u2019s education counts towards Section 80C limit.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The principal repaid during the year on your housing loan is eligible too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The premium payment for the LIC policy which you have been running for the last 15 years counts too.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Hence, <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>count all such investments and figure out how much you need to invest to bridge the gap.<\/strong><\/span> For instance, if you have already put in Rs 1 lac, you just need to invest Rs 50,000 more to maximize the limit.\u00a0Any excess amount (over Rs 1.5 lacs) that you invest in such products does not help you save any tax.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, you have expenses outside tax-saving investments that help saves taxes. Examples: Interest payment on your housing loan, Health Insurance premium, house rent (if you stay on rent and get HRA), leave travel allowance, etc.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All these expenses reduce your taxable income and might bring you under a lower tax bracket. As we have seen earlier, as you move into a lower tax bracket, the tax-savings will reduce.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#3 Don\u2019t Be so Selfish<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insurance planning is the first pillar of financial planning. You must have adequate life, health, and disability coverage. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A term insurance plan is the best and the cheapest way to buy life insurance. The premium is eligible for tax benefit under Section 80C. Health insurance premium is eligible for tax benefit under<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/how-to-save-income-tax-part-ii-tax-benefits-of-health-insurance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Section 80D<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But many of us do not look at these products for tax-saving since such products may not pay anything back. For instance, if you survive the policy term of a term life plan, you will not get anything back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However,<\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b> think about your family too. <\/b><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if something happens to you? How will your family manage the finances if you were not around? A term life insurance plan will help here. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if a family member gets hospitalized for 30 days? Wouldn\u2019t you want to provide the best quality treatment to your family? A health insurance plan will help here. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, <\/span><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><b>buying life and health insurance plans are the best tax-saving decisions you will make.<\/b><\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#4 Various Tax-Saving Products Have Different Lock-in Periods<\/h2>\n<p>Equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS or tax-saving mutual funds) are equity products and have a lock-in period of 3 years. You are not required to invest every year. On the other hand, ULIPs have a lock-in of 5 years. PPF investments have a lock-in of 15 years. NPS investments are locked in (almost) until the investor attains the age of 60.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Moreover, how lock-in periods are treated varies across products.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In ELSS, each installment (investment) is locked in for 3 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In ULIPs, the first year premium is locked in for 5 years. Second year premium is locked-in for 4 years. The premiums paid after the 5<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year face no lock-in period.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PPF is quite similar too. The investment made in the first year is locked-in for 15 years. The investments made in the subsequent years face shorter lock-in periods. For instance, the investment made in the 14<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year will be locked in for just 1 year.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>#5 Invest According to Your Risk Profile<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ELSS is a pure equity product. PPF is a pure debt product. ULIPs can be pure equity, pure debt, or hybrid products. Equity products can be very volatile but offer prospect of high returns. Debt products offer stable returns, but the return potential may not be high. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you are choosing a tax-saving product, it is important to pick a product that is suited to your risk appetite.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>#6 Consider the Commitments and Exit Penalties<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a big problem with insurance and investment combo products. <\/span><strong>Usually, you do not pay premium for just one year. <\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>You must pay the premium for many years.<\/strong> So, this becomes a recurring commitment. You need to see if you can afford such a commitment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let us consider an example. You buy a traditional life insurance plan. The annual premium is Rs 1 lac, and the premium payment term is 10 years. The same annual premium must be paid for 10 years. <\/span><b>What happens if you do not pay? <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you realize later (after paying the first premium) that you bought a wrong product or cannot afford the premium (and do not pay any further premiums), <\/span><b>you may have to forfeit the premium paid i.e., all the money gone down the drain. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Moreover, the tax benefits (availed in the previous years) will be reversed<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Yes, that is true. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you do not pay an annual premium for at least 2 years in a traditional life insurance plan or for at least 5 years in ULIP, the tax benefit will be reversed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With traditional plans, even if you stop paying the premiums after a few years and exit, <\/span><b>you will have to incur heavy exit penalty<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. That is usually not the case with other tax-saving products.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are advised to keep such aspects in mind when you are selecting your tax-saving investments. A short list of Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of Tax Planning<\/h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not rush and pick investments without understanding the product properly.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Such mistakes can happen with traditional life insurance plans and ULIPs because these can be difficult to understand.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>That is why it is important that you plan much in advance.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Do not leave such investments for the month of March.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider your risk profile. You do not go for fancy tax-saving products. <span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"><strong>If you have a low-risk appetite, even a 5-year tax-saving fixed deposit is a fine choice.<\/strong><\/span><\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider lock-in periods and payment commitments.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider asset allocation. For instance, if your asset allocation strategy requires you to put money in equity products, you can pick ELSS. If the strategy requires you to divert money towards fixed income investments, you can pick PPF.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>You do not have to save every possible penny of tax. Do not let your tax saving urges to hold your investments hostage.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many investors make poor investment choices just to save tax.<\/span><b><span style=\"background-color: #ffffaa;\"> Choose investments that are aligned with your financial goals (or planning)<\/span>. <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If such investments also help you save taxes, that is just an additional benefit.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The tax-saving season is round the corner.
