Deepesh Raghaw attempts to explain this concept to our readers in this article.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What would you prefer? Receive Rs 100 today or receive Rs 100 after 1 year.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Clearly, you would prefer to receive Rs 100 today.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two ways to look to explain the answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The money (currency) loses its value over a period of time.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The phenomenon is commonly known as <\/span><b>inflation<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Therefore, Rs 100 today is worth more than Rs 100 after 12 months.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To give an example, with Rs 100, you may be able to purchase 50 pencils today. However, it is possible that you can purchase only 48 pencils after 12 months. In this case, as you can see, the same amount of money can buy you less after a year. Assuming everything else is constant, inflation has reduced the purchasing power of money.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other way to explain your answer is that <\/span><b>you could have invested Rs 100 in a fixed deposit today and at the end of the year, you could have had Rs 106 (say)<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> due to interest income on the fixed deposit. Obviously, it is better to have Rs 106 instead of Rs 100.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>The above concept that money in hand today is worth more than the same amount on a future date (because it can earn returns) is referred to as Time Value of Money.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could have heard stories from your grandparents or great grandparents about how they could purchase an entire month\u2019s grocery for Rs 40 or 50. That amount does not fetch you anything today. That is time value of money for you. 1 kg rice is still 1 kg rice. Just that the value of rupee has gone down due to inflation. To put it another way, the value of Rs 40 or Rs 50 in those days is same as value of Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 today.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Time Value of Money and Your Investments<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4215\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/time-value-of-money.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"642\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/time-value-of-money.png 880w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/time-value-of-money-300x219.png 300w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/time-value-of-money-768x560.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 880px) 100vw, 880px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This concept has great value when it comes to investments or how you think about investments.\u00a0<\/span>When you invest<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you are essentially foregoing consumption today. Now, you know that your money will lose value due to inflation over a period of time. Therefore, your expectation should be such that your investments grow at a pace equal to or faster than your money is losing value.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Considering the earlier example, if I can buy 50 pencils today, I should be able buy at least 50 pencils after a few years with my investment value.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And that is a fair expectation. If this was not true, you would have been better off spending that money than investing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Many of us prefer to keep our investments in fixed deposits.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> However, most of the time, the post-tax return on fixed deposit is unlikely to beat inflation over the long term. This means you are effectively losing out. Your money will be worth less when it matures.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, I am not saying you must not invest in fixed deposits. A bank fixed deposit is a very good product. All I am saying is that you must be aware of its inability to beat inflation. Therefore, a fixed deposit may not be a good investment choice for the long term.\u00a0<\/span><b>While investing for the long term, you must consider some exposure to growth assets such as equities. Such investments are likely to beat inflation over the long term and preserve your purchasing power.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Caveat.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0You cannot earn better returns without taking additional risk. Therefore, even though growth assets such as equities may give you potential of better returns, such assets come with considerably higher risk than bank fixed deposits. And risk can materialize. Therefore, when you invest, the only motive can\u2019t be just to earn inflation-beating returns. The motive should also be to earn returns that are commensurate with the risk you are taking.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Should You Look at Your Investment Returns?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Value of Money also offers an insight into how you should assess your returns from an investment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Common story.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0My father purchased a plot in 1980 for Rs 1 lac. Now, its value is Rs 50 lacs. Essentially, the value has gone up 50 times. Great investment!!!\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, how much of the return is due to rupee losing its value over last 37 years and how much of it is due to investor\u2019s smart decision making?\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the rate of inflation was 8% p.a., the value of Rs 1 lac in 1980 is same as Rs 17 lacs today. Only the return in excess of Rs 17 lacs is due to your intelligent decision making.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Assuming the present value of investment was only Rs 15 lacs (and not Rs 50 lacs), it is not really a very good investment (even though the value has gone up 15 times).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In fact, <\/span><b>even the Government does not tax you on the gains due to inflation.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For instance, long term capital gains on sale of property\/gold\/bonds\/debt funds is 20% after accounting for indexation.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong>Long Term Capital Gain = Sale Price \u2013 Indexed cost of purchase<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Tax liability = 20% * Long Term Capital Gains<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Government releases<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.incometaxindia.gov.in\/Pages\/utilities\/Cost-Inflation-Index.aspx\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">cost of inflation index<\/span><\/a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">that you can use to calculate<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">your indexed cost of purchase.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How Do You Plan Your Retirement?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have seen people do simple calculations to plan for their retirement.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cMy current expenses are Rs 25,000 per month. That makes it Rs 3 lacs per annum (Rs 25,000 X 12). I expect to live for another 30 years. Therefore, I need Rs 90 lacs (Rs 3 lacs X 30 years) by the time I retire.\u201d<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The biggest issue with this approach is that Rs 25,000 per month may be enough today. However, it may not be enough after 30 years (assuming you are 25 years old today). Why? Because inflation would have eaten into the value of your investment.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At 8% inflation, Rs 25,000 after 30 years is same as Rs 2,484 today. Alternatively, if you need Rs 25,000 per month now to meet your expenses, you will need Rs 2.51 lacs per month after 30 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you had planned to save only Rs 90 lacs, you will run out of money within 3 years of your retirement.\u00a0<\/span>To put it another way, <b>you need Rs 90 lacs <\/b><b>in present value <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(and not Rs 90 lacs in future value)<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">for your retirement<\/span>.\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During retirement, inflation can be your biggest enemy. You need to preserve the value of your money by making the right investments.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>How You Can Be Tricked?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Financial services companies tinker around with the timing of cash flows to give you an impression of higher returns.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happens regularly with traditional life insurance plans. Typically, in such plans, bonus is announced every year. However, the bonus is paid only at the time of maturity. Till maturity, the bonus amount simply accrues and does not earn any return.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s say policy matures in 20 years. The insurance company announces a bonus of Rs 40,000 for your policy in the first year. However, you will not get Rs 40,000 after the first year. You will get this amount without interest after 20 years. If, at the time of purchase, you thought you would get Rs 40,000 every year, you got it completely wrong.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you got Rs 40,000 every year, you could have invested the amount and ended up more than Rs 40,000 at the end of 20 years.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have discussed this aspect in great detail in another<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/opinion\/time-money-life-insurance-companies-exploit\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span>The insurance companies realize the time value of money and insurance agents smartly build their sales arguments around these bonuses.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you do not pay attention \u00a0to the timing of cash flows, you may be in for a negative surprise later. Unfortunately, we cannot do such complex calculations in our minds. We need spreadsheets to assess the impact of timing of these cash flows.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time Value of Money is perhaps the foremost concept when it comes to financial planning. If you can\u2019t appreciate the damage inflation can inflict on purchasing power of your assets, it is difficult to plan your finances well.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always remember that\u00a0<\/span><b>money in hand today is more valuable than the same amount of money a year later.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You can invest today, earn return and end up with a higher amount. Alternatively, the purchasing power of money goes down due to inflation, i.e., you can buy more today with same amount than you can after a few years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, those who understand this concept can make it work to their advantage and make prudent investment choices. Those who don\u2019t understand it will be taken advantage of by unscrupulous salesmen and fail to have enough savings for retirement. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Editor&#8217;s Note: In a recent podcast, CIEL&#8217;s Uma Shashikant suggests that &#8216;Time Value of Money&#8217; is the only concept that average person needs to know in personal finance.
