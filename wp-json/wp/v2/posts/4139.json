However, most of those loan products were for established self-employed professionals and salaried individuals working with Government Organizations or established corporates.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the desire to own a home is much deep rooted and almost everyone wants to own a house. And most need a home loan to purchase the house.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss a loan product that targets customers beyond the formal established sector<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. In this post, I will discuss<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbhousing.com\/home-loan\/unnati-home-loans\/eligibility-criteria\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PNB Housing Unnati Home Loan Scheme<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This loan product is targeted at lower and middle income segments in Tier II and Tier III cities and the periphery of Tier I cities. Employees of smaller establishments can also avail this loan facility.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out more about this product.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>PNB Housing Unnati Scheme: Salient Features<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount of Rs 25 lacs subject to a maximum of 90% of the property value<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-employed borrowers can get loan up to 67% of the property value<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure of up to 30 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan available in both fixed rate and floating rate options<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed rate can be 3, 5 and 10 years. Subsequently, the loan will automatically become a floating rate loan<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can expect the interest rates for his loan to be slightly higher. You can check the latest loan rates<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbhousing.com\/home-loan\/unnati-home-loans\/rate-of-interest\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with other home loans, the housing finance company shall take first charge by way of equitable mortgage over the property. The HFC may also ask for additional security, if needed<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Eligibility Criteria<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are eligible for the loan if:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must have a professional degree\/Diploma\/Post-Graduate degree\/ITI etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must be employee of a local and stable business entity such as petrol pump, restaurant, jewelry shops, garment shops etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have minimum monthly income of Rs 10,000. This limit applies to combined income in case there is a joint applicant<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, your age at the time of loan maturity shouldn\u2019t exceed 70 years if you are salaried employee. On the other hand, if you are a self-employed professional\/non-professional, the age at loan maturity should not exceed 65 years.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can check the detailed loan criteria<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbhousing.com\/home-loan\/unnati-home-loans\/eligibility-criteria\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">here<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the PNB Housing website, it is mentioned that <\/span><b>the loan eligibility will be determined taking age, qualification, income and occupation of the applicant<\/b>.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Clearly, your repayment ability will come into picture.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the minimum income is Rs 10,000 and the maximum loan amount is Rs 25 lacs, <\/span>you need to have practical expectations about your home loan eligibility.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For instance, a loan of 25 lacs at 8.5% p.a. for 30 years requires a monthly EMI of Rs 19,222. At Fixed Obligations to Income Ratio (FOIR) of 50%, your monthly income should be ~ Rs 38,000. This is way more than Rs 10,000 per month. <\/span><b>Clearly, if your income is lower, the loan eligibility will also be lower.<\/b><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Author&#8217;s Note<\/strong>: I have relied on the information available on PNB Housing website. It is possible that the bank considers various unwritten rules during the loan sanction process.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3>What Is Noteworthy in This Product?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, you would expect these features in any loan product that targets lower and middle income groups.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By keeping the minimum income low At Rs 10,000 per month, the HFC has brought many prospects into eligibility fold.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The maximum tenure is high at 30 years to keep the EMIs low and increase loan eligibility.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fixed rate option is available up to 10 years so that borrowers can be protected from interest rate fluctuations. This protection is something that a lower or middle income group person may need. For a low income group person, non-discretionary expenses as a percentage of monthly income may be quite high. Such borrowers may find it difficult to manage wild fluctuations in EMIs (as compared to borrowers in the high income group).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please understand that I am not advocating the fixed rate option for this loan product. I am merely saying that it can be useful.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Does the PNB Housing Finance Unnati Scheme Fare against Other Products?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All the products targeted at these income groups will have similar features. Some may have higher maximum loan amount. However, as we have seen in a earlier section, a higher maximum loan amount may not make as much sense.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There could be some difference in eligibility criteria. I pick up a similar product from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.axisbank.com\/retail\/loans\/home-loan\/asha-home-loan\/features-benefits\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Axis Bank<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Features<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>PNB Housing Unnati Scheme<\/b><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Axis Bank Asha Home Loan<\/b><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maximum Loan Amount<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">25 lacs<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">20-28 lacs, depending on the location<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Loan as % of Property value<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 90% for salaried,\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">67% for self-employed<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 85% of the property value<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Maximum Loan Tenure<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 years<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">30 years<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>EMI Waiver<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yes, subject to conditions<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Minimum Monthly Income<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">10,000<\/span><\/td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">8,000-10,000 depending on the location<\/span><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As expected, not much difference.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Additional Point to Note<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is possible that your loan qualifies for credit linked loan subsidy under<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/emicalculator.net\/credit-linked-subsidy-scheme-for-first-time-home-buyers\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (PMAY)<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Do check out the eligibility and the process while applying for the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Caution<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PNB Housing,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnbhousing.com\/home-loan\/unnati-home-loans\/insurance-customer-safety\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the loan page<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, suggests that you get your property and loan repayments insured. Noble thought indeed.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most banks\/HFCs insist on purchasing life insurance for the loan amount. This ensures that, in the event of your demise, the money from the life insurance policy can be used to square off the loan. However, there is no need to purchase such life insurance from the bank itself. You must avoid purchasing from the bank. Purchase directly from the insurer and get the policy assigned to the bank. You will save a lot of money. I have covered this aspect in<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/emicalculator.net\/home-loan-protection-plan-what-bank-officials-wont-tell-you\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PNB has also tied up with Bajaj Allianz and ICICI Lombard to provide you such coverage. I don\u2019t know whether PNB Housing has tied up whether Bajaj Allianz General Insurance or Bajaj Allianz Life.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, I know that ICICI Lombard is not a life insurance company. It is a general insurance company and does not sell pure life insurance. Therefore, quite possible you will be asked to purchase ICICI Lombard Home Safe Plus Product. This is an utterly useless product and does not cover natural death. How bizarre for a loan insurance product? I have reviewed the product in detail in an<\/span> <a href=\"http:\/\/emicalculator.net\/icici-bank-home-safe-plus-a-review\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not suggesting that you should go with Bajaj Allianz product. All I am saying is that you should understand the insurance product completely before signing the dotted line. To earn commissions, the HFC may push any product. It is your responsibility to purchase the product you need. Always better to purchase directly from a life insurance company.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Given this product is targeted towards the low income groups (which may otherwise not find it easy to get a home loan), it remains to be seen how willing the housing finance company officials are in negotiating this.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We have reviewed many home loan products on this blog.
