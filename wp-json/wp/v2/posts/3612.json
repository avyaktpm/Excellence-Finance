You approached a few friends\/relatives for help. They chipped in but you are still Rs 15 lacs short. You approached a few banks and NBFCs. However, your requests for a personal loan of Rs 15 lacs were politely declined, primarily because you are self-employed.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is not that you are light on assets. You have a few residential and commercial properties that you inherited from your father. You are contemplating selling the one of those properties for the wedding. An emotionally difficult decision for you. While discussing the issue with a friend, he tells you about Loan Against Property (LAP).\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He tells you that under loan against property, you can mortgage an existing property and get a loan against it. Exactly what you were looking for.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want to know more about loan against property (LAP). Let\u2019s find out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Is Loan Against Property (LAP)?<\/h3>\n<p><b>LAP is a secured loan where you mortgage your residential or commercial property and borrow money against it.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, you mortgage one of your residential or commercial properties to the bank and the bank offers you a loan against it.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it is a secured loan, the interest rate might also be lesser than the interest rate for a personal loan.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank\/NBFCs may have declined your request for a personal loan but may approve loan against property since they have security.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And you don\u2019t have to sell the property and bank\u2019s right over the property goes away after you repay the loan.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Is LAP Different from Home Loan?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You take a home loan to purchase a house.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of LAP, you already own the property. You mortgage the property and use the loan amount for some other purpose. You may choose to opt for LAP for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Education<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Medical treatment<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wedding<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Business requirements<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Debt consolidation<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any other purpose<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically, banks don\u2019t put restriction on how you are going to use these funds.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>How Much Loan Can I Get?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That will depend on the value of the property, as assessed by the lender. Do note assessed value of property may be different across lenders.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moreover, you will get only a percentage of the market value as loan. Typically, <\/span><b>lenders limit themselves to 50-70% of the market value.<\/b>\u00a0<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lenders won\u2019t just rely on the market value of the property. <\/span><b>They will also look at your repayment ability before offering you the loan.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To sum up, following are the parameters bank\/NBFC will look at before offering you LAP:<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Market value of property<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Legal and technical clearance of the property title<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Age (both minimum and maximum age may be specified)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your employment status (salaried or self-employed)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your cash flows (salary or annual income)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CIBIL (credit) Score. Higher the better.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Existing assets and liabilities (loans)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bank will make its own assessment of your repayment ability. However, you know about your repayment ability far better.\u00a0<\/span><b>Make sure you have the ability to repay the loan or else you risk losing your property.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Documents Required to Apply for a LAP?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the exact list of documents will vary across banks and NBFCs, I will list down common documents required by banks:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identity and address proof of the borrower<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Salary slips, Form-16 (for salaried)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank Statements, Income Tax Returns, Certified Financial Statements (for self-employed)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Property Documents<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>What Are the Benefits?<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get loan against both residential and commercial property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a secured loan. Hence, you can get this loan at a lower rate as compared to a personal loan. Interest rates for LAP range between 11%-15% p.a. across lenders.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get bigger loans with LAP. Personal loans won\u2019t go beyond Rs 5-10 lacs. With LAP, you can get loans as high as Rs 10 crores.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For many of us, personal loan may not even be an option. Banks\/NBFCs may not be as comfortable offering a personal loan to a self-employed person (as compared to a salaried individual).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You get longer repayment schedule. Some lenders offer repayment tenor of up to 15 years. Tenor of personal loans won\u2019t be more than 3-5 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may get the flexibility to receive the loan amount as lump sum or as an overdraft facility.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no prepayment penalty for <\/span><b>individual borrowers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in case of <\/span><b>floating rate loans<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Please note prepayment penalty may be applicable if you have opted for a fixed rate loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Any Tax Benefits for Repayment of Loans Against Property?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are no tax benefits.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Are the Other Charges Involved?<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan interest is not the only cost that you incur on taking the loan. There are many ancillary charges such as processing fees, registration charges, valuation charges, legal charges etc. Do keep these costs in mind while finalising the lender.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>What Should You Do?<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As with any loan, do not borrow just because you can.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be sure about your repayment ability before opting for LAP. If your repayment ability is suspect, you may just be better off selling your property than taking loan against it. By selling the property outright, you will save on interest cost and many ancillary charges. Do note this is not a generic advice. Decision may depend on many parameters such as market conditions and emotional attachment with the property.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though loan against property is likely to be better than personal loan in terms of interest rate, do shop around for personal loan rates too. You might just find a close quote for personal loan too.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to take loan for daughter\u2019s (or son\u2019s) education, you can ask her to opt for education loan. Not only is education loan likely to be cheaper, she will also get tax benefit for education loan repayment.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to prepay the loan much ahead of the schedule, it is better to opt for floating rate loan.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shop around for lower interest rate, processing fee and other ancillary charges.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You need Rs 20 lacs to fund a wedding in the family.
