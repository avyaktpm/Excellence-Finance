Moreover, loans are easily available these days if you have the right credit profile.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I frequently come across articles where the authors advocate a particular kind of loan over the sale of an asset (or withdrawal from an asset). In an<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/medical-loan-vs-health-insurance\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">earlier post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, I had compared medical loans and health insurance. I got the idea about the post after reading an article which had an insipid suggestion that a medical loan is a better option than health insurance to take care of your hospital bills. <strong>When your tool is a hammer, every problem looks like nail.<\/strong> A lender can only offer loans. Therefore, for any need of funds, they show that a loan is a better option. Such articles are motivated and sales-oriented and should be seen in such light.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As someone who finds himself in such a situation, what would you do? Would you sell one or more of your assets or would you apply for a loan? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s look at the pros and cons.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Why Sale or Withdrawal from an Asset Is Likely a Better Option?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You must pay interest on the loan. For some of the loan variants, the rate of interest can be quite high. Had you sold the asset \/ investment, you wouldn\u2019t have to incur the interest cost. Moreover, <\/span><b>you must also compare the returns from asset you didn\u2019t sell with the loan interest rate.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is foolish to continue with your bank fixed deposit at 8% and take a personal loan at 10 to 12% p.a.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even for the assets that can yield potentially more than cost of your loan, you must consider that the returns from high yielding assets are not guaranteed but the loan must be repaid. Let\u2019s say you have Rs 20 lacs equity portfolio. Your equity investments may offer you more than 10% p.a. over the long term. However, there is no guarantee of good returns and no guarantee that you will get good returns year after year. For all you know, you may be down 10% in the next 12 months while you continued to pay 10% on your loan. Taking loan while holding the investment wouldn\u2019t look like such a good decision, would it?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan must be repaid. If you cannot repay, there will be penalties and many other hassles. <\/span><b>If you have taken a secured loan, you can lose control of the asset if you can\u2019t repay the loan for any reason.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This is important especially when your repayment ability is suspect. You took the loan because you didn\u2019t want to sell. However, if you can\u2019t repay the loan, the bank will eventually sell it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>In my opinion, sale of an asset (withdrawal) is likely to be a better choice in most cases.<\/b> However, there could be some situations where you may be forced to consider availing a loan instead.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>When the Sale of Asset Can Be a Tricky Choice<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is a heavy transaction cost. For instance, real estate transactions will have heavy transaction cost.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are tax implications. Sale of an asset typically results in capital gains and you must pay tax on those gains.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There can be penalty on exiting the investment before maturity. For instance, in case of bank fixed deposits, there can be a small penalty for premature closure. Moreover, you may be offered an interest rate for the shorter duration (period for which you maintained the fixed deposit and not the original tenure).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fund requirement is much smaller than the value of the asset. You may not want to sell a Rs. 2 crore property to fund a Rs 10 lakh requirement. The operational hassles, transaction and tax cost may be too much.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similarly, you may not want to break a 2 crore Bank Fixed deposit to fund a Rs. 20 lacs requirement. This is especially if the interest rates have gone down since you made the first FD. I have discussed this aspect in detail in<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-bank-fixed-deposit-fd\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">another post<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>Re-investing the money in the same instrument is difficult.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Let\u2019s consider the example of Public Provident Fund (PPF). You can make partial withdrawals from the 7<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year. Once the account completes the initial maturity, the withdrawals are much more flexible. So, you can take out money from PPF easily. However, you cannot put more than Rs 1.5 lacs in a financial year. Therefore, if you take out a big chunk from PPF, you may not be able to replenish it later even if you have the money.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><b>There is a strong emotional connect with the asset.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Examples could be your ancestral property or gold.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You believe that the asset is worth much more, but you think you wouldn\u2019t be able to get to right price under current market conditions. You may be right but you may also be living under an illusion. For all you know, your asset\/property may not be worth as much.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do note the presence of aforementioned factors does not necessarily rule out the sale of the asset or withdrawal from it. It merely requires you to dig deeper and do a holistic cost benefit analysis. Be rational.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You need money but you do not have cash readily available. What would you do?
