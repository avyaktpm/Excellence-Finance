In many of our earlier posts, we have discussed<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/gold-loan-unlocking-cash-for-emergency-needs\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan against gold jewellery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/sbi-loan-against-property-sbi-lap\/\">loan against property<\/a>,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-lic-policies\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan against insurance policies<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-securities\/\">loan against financial investments (securities)<\/a>.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since gold, insurance plans and securities make for relatively liquid and quality collateral, getting a loan against such items can also be swift.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let\u2019s look at loan against securities product from the Bank of Baroda, a major Public sector bank. As per Bank of Baroda website, the loan is available only against NSC, KVP, insurance policies and government bonds. There is no mention of loan against equity shares or mutual fund units.\u00a0<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Let\u2019s find out more about the offering from Bank of Baroda.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Loan against National Savings Certificate (NSC)\/Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP)<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available as both term loan and overdraft<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Loan Amount: Rs 3,000 (term loan), Rs 20,000 (overdraft)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount:<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 85% of the Face value of NSC\/KVP, if the residual maturity period is less than 3 years.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 80% of the Face value of NSC\/KVP, if the residual maturity period is 3 years and above.<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure: There is no mention of maximum tenure. However, as I understand, the loan tenure must be such that the loan is repaid before the NSC\/KVP matures.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can get<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/loan-against-ppf-account\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">loan against PPF account<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> too. However, you can take PPF loan only from the bank or post office where you maintain your PPF account. Therefore, if you maintain your PPF account with the State Bank of India, you can borrow against your PPF account only from the SBI.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Loan against Insurance Policies<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available as both term loan and overdraft<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Loan Amount: Rs 3,000 (term loan), Rs 20,000 (overdraft)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 85% of the surrender value, if the insurance policy is maturing within 3 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 80% of the surrender value, if the insurance policy is maturing after 3 years<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Note that the Surrender Value is not the same as Maturity Value or Sum Assured under the policy or the total premium paid. It is the amount that the insurer will pay you if you were to surrender the policy today. The surrender value of the policy is quite low in the initial years (even lower than the amount of premiums paid).<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure: Maximum 5 years. The loan tenure cannot run beyond the policy maturity date. i.e., the loan must be repaid before the policy maturity date<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The loan facility is available only against traditional life insurance plans<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan facility not available against Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs) or term life insurance plans<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Loan against Government\/RBI Bonds<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Available as both term loan and overdraft<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minimum Loan Amount: Rs 3,000 (term loan), Rs 20,000 (overdraft)<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maximum Loan Amount:<\/span>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 85% of the Face value of the bond, if the residual maturity period is less than 3 years<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up to 80% of the Face value of the bond, if the residual maturity period is 3 years and above<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loan Tenure: No information provided on the website. However, the loan tenure will end before the bond matures<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can not take loan against any Government or RBI bond<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all bonds issued by the Government of India can be offered as collateral for loans. For instance,<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.personalfinanceplan.in\/goi-savings-taxable-bonds-2018\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Government of India 7.75% Savings (Taxable) Bonds, 2018<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are not eligible as collateral for loans. There is a<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rbi.org.in\/commonman\/English\/Scripts\/Notification.aspx?Id=101\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technical reason<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> why the Reserve Bank does not allow this. Therefore, no bank can offer you loan against such bonds. Similarly, you cannot take loan against NHAI or REC bonds. You invest in these bonds to saves taxes from the sale of house 54EC. If you do, the tax benefits under Section 54EC are revoked<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, you can take a loan against Sovereign Gold Bonds<\/span><\/li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank of Baroda provides loan against any Government bond that is an eligible security for a loan<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>What Is the Rate of Interest?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I reproduce the rates from Bank of Baroda website. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can check the latest interest rates on<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bankofbaroda.com\/interest-rates-charges.htm\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bank of Baroda website<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4587\" src=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/loan-interest-rates.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"601\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/loan-interest-rates.png 601w, https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/loan-interest-rates-300x102.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The processing fee shall be Rs 500, plus applicable taxes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rate of interest, as mentioned on the website, looks quite high. Do note that the security provided is very high quality. At present 1-year MCLR for Bank of Baroda is 8.65% p.a. Assuming strategic premium to be zero, the loan interest rate is between 13.15% and 13.65% p.a. T<\/span><b>he interest rates are clearly quite high compared to rates for the other banks.\u00a0<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By the way, with public sector banks, there is always the risk of the information on the website being outdated.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are an existing account holder with Bank of Baroda and demonstrate good repayment ability (salaried, enough income), you will probably get a personal loan at a lower rate of interest. Many banks may offer a better rate of interest even for loan against mutual funds or equity shares. Therefore, if you have existing relationship with other banks, you can try similar loan products from other banks too.
