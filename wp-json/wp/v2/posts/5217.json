Charge cards are not very common. As I understand, only American Express offers charge cards in India. To add to the confusion, American Express offers credit cards too. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With respect to the usage, there is little to differentiate between a credit card and a charge card. You get credit for your purchases and you must pay by the statement due date. If you have been spending responsibly and have been paying your dues in full on time, you would not notice any difference. I am sure many American Express customers won\u2019t even realize whether they hold a charge card or a credit card. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this post, let\u2019s explore the few yet important differences between credit cards and charge cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Charge Cards Don\u2019t Have Any Pre-Set Spending Limit<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit cards have credit limits. Your bank will usually provide you a credit limit that is 3-4 times your monthly income. You can\u2019t spend more than your credit limit.\u00a0 Or your card outstanding can\u2019t exceed the credit limit at any point in time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Charge cards have no such concept. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I copy an excerpt from<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/content\/dam\/amex\/in\/legal\/mitc\/charge-english-mitc.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Express Charge Cards MITC<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is no preset spending limit on the Charge Card. \u201cNo PreSet Limit\u201d does not mean spending is unlimited. American Express approves charges (spends done on Merchant Establishments in India or overseas) based on the declared financials, spending pattern, credit record and Account history. American Express reserves the absolute right to deny authorisation for any requested charge. The Cardmember can call up the helpline to understand the amount he may spend on the Card.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h2>How Do You Check How Much You Can Spend on Your Charge Card?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of American Express, you can check your spending power when you log in to the card portal. You can enter the expected purchase amount and submit to check if the purchase for such an amount will be approved. Confusing, isn\u2019t it? <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am not sure if not having a preset spending limit is good or bad. One thing is sure though. If you are reckless, can\u2019t control your spending urges and don\u2019t manage your cashflows well, charge cards can be disastrous. On the other hand, if you manage your finances well, a charge with no preset limit (and potentially a higher one too) can provide you a lot of flexibility. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In my opinion, charge card issuers would have relatively stringent eligibility criteria as compared to credit card issuers.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>There Is No Concept of Minimum Payment Due in Charge Cards<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In credit cards, you do not necessarily have to pay the bill amount in full. You can get away with paying the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/emicalculator.net\/why-paying-credit-card-minimum-payment-due-is-a-bad-idea\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">minimum amount due<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> every month. Usually, minimum amount due is 5% of the outstanding bill amount. If you have signed up for credit card EMI, the EMIs are also added to the Minimum Amount Due.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, if your cashflows are stretched for any reason, you may find value in \u201cMinimum Amount Due\u201d feature. However, getting away with Minimum Amount Due has its own set of major drawbacks. You pay interest on the unpaid amount from the date of purchase. You lose the interest-free credit period facility. More importantly, Minimum Amount Due is only a stop-gap arrangement. If you can only make minimum payments on your credit card for more than a few months, you may have already taken your first steps towards a debt trap.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The only positive, apart from the payment flexibility, is that your account is reported as regular to the credit bureaus.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A poor credit score can affect your ability to access credit in the future. Moreover, if you have a poor credit score, you may be asked to pay a higher rate of interest on your loans in the future. If you plan to take a loan or apply for a credit card in the near future, this is not a small positive though.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case of Charge Cards, you must pay the outstanding amount in full. There is no such thing as the minimum payments. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I copy the terms and conditions from the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/content\/dam\/amex\/in\/legal\/mitc\/Gold%20CMA%203rd%20Oct.pdf\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Express Gold Card Terms &amp; Conditions<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> available on American Express website.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If we do not receive payment in full of the Charges shown on any monthly statement by the due date, Late Payment Charges will be levied at the rate of five percent (5%) on the unpaid balance. Subsequently, Late Payment Charges at the rate of 5% per month will be levied on any unpaid balances at the end of each interval of 30 days until payment is received in full. The minimum monthly Late Payment Charge shall be Rs. 300. Details of Late Payment Charges will be included in your monthly statement and unpaid Late Payment Charges will themselves be treated as overdue amounts and will be further subject to Late Payment Charges.<\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With respect to the charges, there is not much to differentiate. Credit card charges work in the similar manner. The only difference is that this American Express Card charges interest under the name of Late Payment Charges or delinquency fee. Credit Cards have explicit interest component, late payment fees etc. However, the impact is the same in both cases. You pay a very heavy interest for not settling the card amount in full. Late Payment Charge at 5% looks higher as compared to credit card (that charges between 3-4%). However, our sample set is very small. Moreover, credit cards have a host of other charges too for late payments (late payment fee etc). In this American Express card, everything seems to be built-in into a single charge.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>An important point with charge cards is that, since the amount must be paid in full, you must pay the full amount to avoid adverse reporting to the credit bureaus.<\/b><\/p>\n<h3>Fees and Rewards<\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sample set is very small for charge cards. Therefore, we can\u2019t make generic statements. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, by looking at the<\/span> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.americanexpress.com\/content\/dam\/amex\/in\/legal-disclosures\/Schedule-of-Fee-and-Charges.pdf?inav=in_sitefooter_top_links_schedule_of_fees_and_charges\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">statement of charges for American Express Credit Cards and Charge Cards<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, it appears that Charge cards have higher annual fees. For instance, American Express Platinum Charge Card has an annual fee of Rs 60,000 plus taxes. For the other charge cards, the annual fee is relatively low. If you spend well on your credit card\/ charge card and have maintained a good credit history with the issuer, you can get the annual fee waived off or at least get a substantial discount on the annual fee.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the rewards front, you should expect better offers\/airport lounge access\/rewards from charge cards if you are paying a heavy annual fee but that may not always be true. This entire field is very competitive.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>What do you prefer?
